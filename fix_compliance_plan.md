# Redfish Protocol Compliance Fix Plan

This document outlines the plan to fix Redfish protocol compliance issues identified by the Redfish Protocol Validator. The plan is divided into stages, with each stage focusing on a cluster of related failures. Progress is tracked by percentage complete for each stage.

## Overall Status
- **Total Failures**: 44
- **Current Pass Rate**: ~58% (61/105 testable assertions)
- **Target Pass Rate**: >90%

## Stages

### Stage 1: Stabilize Server and Test Environment (Priority: Critical)
**Description**: Eliminate connection errors (status 600) by ensuring the server runs reliably during tests. This affects ~70% of failures.
**Tasks**:
- Implement robust server startup (background process with monitoring).
- Add health checks and error handling to prevent crashes.
- Test server stability under load.
**Percentage Complete**: 100%
**Expected Outcome**: No 600 status codes in validator runs.

### Stage 2: Implement HTTPS/TLS Support (Priority: High)
**Description**: Enable HTTPS by default and enforce TLS requirements for authentication.
**Tasks**:
- Configure TLS certificates and enable HTTPS.
- Add HTTPS redirects for auth requests.
- Ensure TLS v1.1+ support.
**Percentage Complete**: 100%
**Expected Outcome**: Pass TLS and HTTPS enforcement tests.

### Stage 3: Add Missing HTTP Headers (Priority: High)
**Description**: Ensure all responses include required headers like Allow, Cache-Control, Content-Type, OData-Version, and Link.
**Tasks**:
- Update response handlers in server code.
- Add middleware for common headers.
- Verify headers on all GET/HEAD responses.
**Percentage Complete**: 100%
**Expected Outcome**: Pass header-related assertions.

### Stage 4: Fix Authentication and Session Management (Priority: High)
**Description**: Implement proper session creation and predefined roles.
**Tasks**:
- Fix session POST to return Location and X-Auth-Token headers.
- Add Administrator, Operator, and ReadOnly roles.
- Enforce HTTPS for sessions and basic auth.
**Percentage Complete**: 100%
**Expected Outcome**: Pass session and role tests.

### Stage 5: Improve Error Responses for Unsupported Methods (Priority: Medium)
**Description**: Return correct status codes (405/501) for unsupported methods instead of 600.
**Tasks**:
- Update routing logic for unsupported methods.
- Add method validation in handlers.
**Percentage Complete**: 0%
**Expected Outcome**: Pass method support tests.

### Stage 6: Fix OData and Metadata Documents (Priority: Medium)
**Description**: Correct OData service document and metadata XML.
**Tasks**:
- Fix OData service document structure.
- Ensure valid metadata XML with EntityContainer.
- Set correct MIME types.
**Percentage Complete**: 0%
**Expected Outcome**: Pass OData tests.

### Stage 7: Implement Missing Features (Priority: Medium-Low)
**Description**: Add ETags, query parameters, and other gaps.
**Tasks**:
- Implement ETags for resources.
- Add ProtocolFeaturesSupported to service root.
- Ensure URI consistency for sessions.
**Percentage Complete**: 0%
**Expected Outcome**: Pass feature-specific tests.

### Stage 8: Re-validate and Iterate (Priority: Ongoing)
**Description**: Run full validation after each stage and address regressions.
**Tasks**:
- Re-run validator.
- Update this plan with progress.
- Add unit tests for stability.
**Percentage Complete**: 0%
**Expected Outcome**: Achieve >90% pass rate.
