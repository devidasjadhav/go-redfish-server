Redfish Specification DSP0266
14 Published Version 1.23.0
Introduction
Redfish is a standard that uses RESTful interface semantics to access a schema-based data model to conduct
management operations. It is suitable for a wide range of devices, from stand-alone servers to composable
infrastructures and large-scale cloud environments.
The initial Redfish scope targeted servers. DMTF and its alliance partners expanded that scope to cover most data
center IT equipment and other solutions, and both in- and out-of-band access methods.
Additionally, DMTF and other organizations that use Redfish as part of their industry standard or solution have added
educational material.
This document defines the RESTful interface protocol and the various concepts and services necessary to implement
a Redfish interface. The definition of the schema based data model and standard messages for the Redfish interface
are covered separately in the following documents:
â¢ DMTF DSP8010, Redfish Schema Bundle, https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/DSP8010 contains the individual schema
definition files in multiple schema description languages.
â¢ DMTF DSP0268, Redfish Data Model Specification, https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/DSP0268 contains the normative
descriptions and example payloads for all standard Redfish schema in a single reference guide.
â¢ DMTF DSP8011, Redfish Standard Registries Bundle, https://www.dmtf.org/dsp/DSP8011 contains the
message registries used for error reporting and event messages.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 15
1 Scope
This specification defines the required protocols, data model, behaviors, and other architectural components for an
interoperable, multivendor, remote, and out-of-band capable interface. This interface meets the cloud-based and
web-based IT professionals' expectations for scalable platform management. While large and hyperscale
environments are the primary focus, clients can use the specification for individual system management.
The specification defines the required elements for all Redfish implementations, and the optional elements that
system vendors and manufacturers can choose. This specification also defines at which points an implementation
can provide OEM-specific extensions.
The specification sets normative requirements for Redfish services and associated materials, such as Redfish
schema files. In general, the specification does not set requirements for Redfish clients but indicates how a client can
successfully and effectively access and use a Redfish service.
The specification does not require that implementations of the Redfish interfaces and functions require particular
hardware or firmware.

DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 25
5 Overview
Redfish is a management standard that uses a data model representation with a RESTful interface.
Being RESTful, Redfish is easier to use and implement.
Being model-oriented, it can express the relationships between components and the semantics of the Redfish
services and components within them. The model is also easy to extend.
By requiring JSON representation, Redfish enables easy integration with programming environments. It is also easy
to interpret by humans.
An interoperable Redfish schema defines this model, which is freely available and published in OpenAPI YAML,
OData CSDL, and JSON Schema formats.
5.1 Goals
As an architecture, data model, and set of protocols that enable a client to access Redfish services, Redfish has
these goals.
Table 1 describes these goals:
Table 1 â Redfish goals
Goal Purpose
Scalable Can scale on stand-alone machines or racks of equipment.
Flexible Can implement through existing hardware or entirely as a software service.
Extensible Can easily add new and vendor-specific capabilities to the data model.
Backward-compatible Can add capabilities while preserving investments in earlier implementations.
Interoperable Provides consistent functionality across multiple vendor implementations.
Standards-based Built on ubiquitous and secure protocols. Leverages other standards where applicable.
Simple Easy-to-use without the need for highly specialized programming skills or systems knowledge.
Lightweight Designed to reduce complexity and implementation costs. Minimizes the required footprint forimplementations.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
26 Published Version 1.23.0
5.2 Design tenets
To deliver these goals, Redfish:
â¢ Provides a RESTful interface by using a JSON payload and a data model.
â¢ Separates the protocol from the data model, which enables the independent revision and use of each.
â¢ Specifies versioning rules for protocols and schema.
â¢ Leverages strength of ubiquitous standards where it meets architectural requirements, such as JSON, HTTP,
OData, OpenAPI, and the RFCs that this document references.
â¢ Organizes the data model so that it provides clearly demarcated and value-add features in the same payload as
standardized items.
â¢ Makes data in payloads as obvious in context as possible.
â¢ Maintains implementation flexibility. Does not tie the interface to any particular underlying implementation or
architecture.
â¢ Focuses on widely used capabilities. To avoid complexity, does not add functions that only a small percentage of
users value.
5.3 Limitations
Redfish minimizes the need for clients to complete upgrades by using strict versioning and forward-compatibility
rules, and separation of the protocols from the data model. However, Redfish does not guarantee that clients never
need to update their software. For example, clients might need to upgrade to manage new system or component
types, or update the data model.
Interoperable does not mean identical. Many elements of Redfish are optional. Clients should be prepared to
discover the optional elements by using the built-in discovery methods.
The resource tree reflects the topology of the system and its devices. Consequently, different hardware or device
types result in different resource trees, even for identical systems from the same manufacturer. References between
resources may result in a graph instead of a tree. Clients that traverse the resource tree should provide logic to avoid
infinite loops.
Additionally, not all Redfish resources use simple REST read-and-write semantics. Different use cases may follow
other types of client logic. For example, clients cannot simply read user credentials or certificates from one service
and write them to another service.
Finally, the hyperlink values between resources and other elements can vary across implementations. Clients should
not assume that they can reuse hyperlinks across different Redfish service instances.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 27
5.4 Additional design background and rationale
5.4.1 REST-based interface
Redfish exposes many service applications as RESTful interfaces. This document defines a RESTful interface.
Redfish defines a RESTful interface because it:
â¢ Enables a lightweight implementation, using fewer layers than previous standards.
â¢ Is a prevalent access method in the industry.
â¢ Is easy to learn, document, and implement in modern programming languages.
â¢ Has a number of development environments and a healthy tooling ecosystem.
â¢ Fits with the design goal of simplicity.
â¢ Equally applies to software application space as it does to embedded environments, which enables convergence
and sharing of code within the management ecosystem.
â¢ Adapts well to any data modeling language.
â¢ Has industry-provided security and discovery mechanisms.
5.4.2 Data-oriented
The Redfish data model is developed by focusing on the contents of the payload. By concentrating on the contents of
the payload first, Redfish payloads are easily mapped to schema definition languages and encoding types. The data
model is defined in various schema languages, including OpenAPI YAML, OData CSDL, and JSON Schema.
5.4.3 Separation of protocol from data model
Redfish separates the protocol operations from the data model and versions the protocol independently from the data
model. This enables clients to extend and change the data model as needed without requiring the protocol version to
change.
5.4.4 Hypermedia API service root
Redfish has a single service root URI and clients can discover all resources through referenced URIs. The
hypermedia API enables the discovery of resources through hyperlinks.
5.4.5 OpenAPI v3.0 support
The OpenAPI v3.0 provides a rich ecosystem of tools for using RESTful interfaces that meet the design requirements
of that specification. Starting with Redfish Specification v1.6.0, the Redfish schemas support the OpenAPI YAML file
format and URI patterns that conform to the OpenAPI Specification were defined. Conforming Redfish services that
Redfish Specification DSP0266
28 Published Version 1.23.0
support the Redfish protocol version v1.6.0 or later implement those URI patterns to enable use of the OpenAPI
ecosystem.
For details, see OpenAPI Specification v3.0.
5.4.6 OData conventions
With the popularity of RESTful APIs, there are nearly as many RESTful interfaces as there are applications. While
following REST patterns helps promote good practices, due to design differences between the many RESTful APIs
there few common conventions between them.
To provide for interoperability between APIs, OData defines a set of common RESTful conventions and annotations.
Redfish follows OData conventions for describing schema, URL conventions, and definitions for typical properties in
a JSON payload.
5.5 Service elements
5.5.1 Synchronous and asynchronous operation support
Some operations can take more time than a client typically wants to wait. For this reason, some operations can be
asynchronous at the discretion of the service. The request portion of an asynchronous operation is no different from
the request portion of a synchronous operation.
To determine whether an operation was completed synchronously or asynchronously, clients can review the HTTP
status codes. For more information, see the Asynchronous operations clause.
5.5.2 Eventing mechanism
Redfish enables clients to receive messages outside the normal request and response paradigm. The service uses
these messages, or events, to asynchronously notify the client of a state change or error condition, usually of a time
critical nature.
This specification defines two styles of eventing:
â¢ Push-style eventing.
When the service detects the need to send an event, it calls HTTP POST to push the event message to the
client. Clients can enable reception of events by creating a subscription entry in the event service, or an
administrator can create subscriptions as part of the Redfish service configuration.
```
â¢ Server-sent events (SSE)-style eventing.
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 29
The client opens an SSE connection to the service through a GET on the ServerSentEventUri -specified URI in
the event service.
For information, see the Eventing clause.
5.5.3 Actions
Actions are Redfish operations that do not easily map to RESTful interface semantics. These types of operations
may not directly affect properties in the Redfish resources. The Redfish schema defines certain standard actions for
common Redfish resources. For these standard actions, the Redfish schema contains the normative language on the
behavior of the action.
5.5.4 Service discovery
While the service itself is at a well-known URI, clients need to discover the network address of the service. Like
UPnP, Redfish uses SSDP for discovery. A wide variety of devices, such as printers and client operating systems,
support SSDP. It is simple, lightweight, IPv6 capable, and suitable for implementation in embedded environments.
For more information, see the Discovery clause.
5.5.5 Remote access support
Remote management functionality typically includes access mechanisms for redirecting operator interfaces such as
```
serial console, keyboard video and mouse (KVM-IP), command shell, or command-line interface, and virtual media.
```
While these mechanisms are critical functionality, they cannot be reasonably implemented as a RESTful interface.
Therefore, this standard does not define the protocols or access mechanisms for those services but encourages
implementations that leverage existing standards. However, the Redfish schema includes resources and properties
that enable client discovery of these capabilities and access mechanisms to enable interoperability.
5.6 Security
The challenge of remote interface security is to protect both the interface and exchanged data. To accomplish this,
Redfish provides authentication and encryption. As part of this security, Redfish defines and requires minimum levels
of encryption.
For more information, see the Security details clause.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
30 Published Version 1.23.0
6 Protocol details
In this document, the Redfish protocol refers to the RESTful mapping to HTTP, TCP/IP, and other protocol, transport,
and messaging layer aspects. HTTP is the application protocol that transports the messages and TCP/IP is the
transport protocol. The RESTful interface is a mapping to the message protocol.
The Redfish protocol is designed around a web service-based interface model, which provides network and
```
interaction efficiency for both user interface (UI) and automation usage. Specifically, the protocol can leverage
```
existing tool chains.
Table 2 describes the items that the Redfish protocol uses:
Table 2 â Redfish protocol
Item Description
HTTP methods Maps to common CRUD operations.
Actions Expands operations beyond CRUD-type operations.
Media types Negotiates the type of data sent in the message body.
HTTP status codes Indicates the success or failure of the server's request.
Error responses Returns more information than HTTP status codes.
TLS Secures messages. See Security details.
Asynchronous semantics Manages long-running operations.
A Redfish interface shall be exposed through a web service endpoint implemented by using HTTP version 1.1. See
RFC7230, RFC7231, and RFC7232.
A Redfish interface may additionally be exposed through a web service endpoint implemented by using HTTP
version 2.0. See RFC7540.
The subsequent clauses describe how the Redfish interface uses and adds constraints to HTTP to ensure
interoperability of Redfish implementations.
6.1 Universal Resource Identifiers
```
A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) identifies a resource, including the service root and all Redfish resources.
```
â¢ A URI shall identify each unique instance of a resource.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 31
â¢ URIs shall not include any RFC1738-defined unsafe characters.
```
â¦ For example, the { , } , , | , ^ , ~ , [ , ] , ` , and \ characters are unsafe because gateways and
```
other transport agents can sometimes modify these characters.
â¦ Do not use the # character for anything other than the start of a fragment.
â¢ URIs shall not include any percent-encoding of characters. This restriction does not apply to the query
parameters portion of the URI.
A GET operation on a URI returns a representation of the resource with properties and hyperlinks to associated
resources. The service root URI is well known and is based on the protocol version.
To discover the URIs to additional resources, extract the associated resource hyperlinks from earlier responses. The
hypermedia API enables the discovery of resources through hyperlinks.
Redfish considers the RFC3986-defined scheme, authority, service root, and version, and unique resource path
component parts of the URI.
For example, this URI:
```
https://mgmt.vendor.com/redfish/v1/Systems/1
```
Contains these component parts:
â¢ https: is the scheme.
â¢ mgmt.vendor.com is the authority to which to delegate the URI.
â¢ redfish/v1 is the service root and version.
â¢ Systems/1 is the unique resource path.
In a URI:
â¢ The scheme and authority component parts are not part of the unique resource path because redirection
capabilities and local operations may cause the connection portion to vary.
â¢ The service root and resource path component parts uniquely identify the resource in a Redfish service.
In an implementation:
â¢ The resource path component part shall be unique.
â¢ A relative reference in the body and HTTP headers payload can identify a resource in that same implementation.
â¢ An absolute URI in the body and HTTP headers payload can identify a resource in a different implementation.
For the absolute URI definition, see RFC3986.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
32 Published Version 1.23.0
For example, a POST operation may return the /redfish/v1/Systems/2 URI in the Location header of the response,
which points to the POST -created resource.
Assuming that the client connects through the mgmt.vendor.com appliance, the client accesses the resource through
the https://mgmt.vendor.com/redfish/v1/Systems/2 absolute URI.
URIs that conform to RFC3986 may also contain the query, ?query , and frag, #frag , components. For information
```
about queries, see Query parameters. When a URI includes a fragment ( frag ) to submit an operation, the server
```
ignores the fragment.
If a property in a response references another property within a resource, use the RFC6901-defined URI fragment
identifier representation format. If the property is a reference property in the schema, the fragment shall reference a
valid resource identifier. For example, the following fragment identifies a property at index 0 of the Fans array in the
/redfish/v1/Chassis/MultiBladeEncl/Thermal resource:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/MultiBladeEncl/Thermal#/Fans/0"
```
}
```
For requirements on constructing Redfish URIs, see the resource URI patterns annotation clause.
6.2 HTTP methods
Table 3 describes the mapping of HTTP methods to the Redfish-supported operations. If the Required column
contains Yes, a Redfish interface shall support the HTTP method. If the Required column contains No, a Redfish
interface may support the HTTP method.

For HTTP methods that the Redfish service does not support or that Table 3 omits, the Redfish service shall return
the HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed status code or the HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code.
6.3 HTTP redirect
HTTP redirect enables a service to redirect a request to another URL. Among other things, HTTP redirect enables
Redfish resources to alias areas of the data model.
All Redfish clients shall correctly handle HTTP redirect.
The service for the redirected resource shall enforce the authentication and authorization requirements for the
redirected resource.
6.4 Media types
Some resources may be available in more than one type of representation. The media type indicates the
representation type.
In HTTP messages, the media type is specified in the Content-Type header. To tell a service to return the response
through certain media types, the client sets the HTTP Accept header to a list of the media types.
â¢ All resources shall be available through the JSON application/json media type.
â¢ Redfish services shall make every resource available in a JSON-based representation as a JSON object, as
specified in RFC8259. Receivers shall not reject a JSON-encoded message, and shall offer at least one JSON-
based response representation. An implementation may offer additional non-JSON media type representations.
To request compression in the response body, clients specify an Accept-Encoding request header.
6.5 ETags
To reduce unnecessary RESTful accesses to resources, the Redfish service should support the association of a
```
separate entity tag (ETag) with each resource.
```
â¢ Implementations should support the return of ETag properties for each resource.
â¢ Implementations should support the return of ETag headers for each single-resource response.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
34 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ Implementations shall support the return of ETag headers for GET requests of ManagerAccount resources.
Because the service knows whether the new version of the object is substantially different, the service generates and
provides the ETag as part of the resource payload.
The ETag mechanism supports both strong and weak validation. If a resource supports an ETag, it shall use the
RFC7232-defined ETag.
This specification does not mandate a particular algorithm for ETag creation, but ETags should be highly collision-
free.
An ETag can be:
â¢ A hash
â¢ A generation ID
â¢ A time stamp
â¢ Some other value that changes when the underlying object changes
If a client performs a PUT operation or PATCH operation to update a resource, it should include an ETag from a
previous GET in the HTTP If-Match or If-None-Match header. Both strong and weak ETags are allowed in these
headers. If a service supports the return of the ETag header on a resource, it may respond with the HTTP 428
Precondition Required status code if the If-Match or If-None-Match header is missing from the PUT or PATCH
request for the same resource, as specified in RFC6585. Services should perform weak ETag comparison when
verifying the ETag provided by the client in PUT or PATCH operations. Clients should treat ETags received from
services as opaque values and not modify them when providing them in PUT or PATCH operations.
In addition to the return of the ETag property on each resource, a Redfish service should return the ETag header on:
â¢ A client PUT , POST , or PATCH operation
â¢ A GET operation for an individual resource
The format of the ETag header is:
```
ETag: <string>
```
For responses to $expand requests:
â¢ The @odata.etag property of each resource in the response shall contain the ETag of the resource as if it were
not expanded.
â¢ The ETag header should contain the ETag of the entire response body.
Services should omit properties named DateTime from ETag calculations. Properties named DateTime represent
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 35
clock settings that increment monotonically over time. Services should implement methods to reduce the frequency
of ETag updates for other types of fast changing properties, such the Reading property in the Sensor resource, for
ETag calculations.
Special handling of ETag calculations is important for clients that use the If-Match header to prevent collisions with
other clients. For example, if a client is attempting to modify a Manager resource and the DateTime property updates
the ETag every second, a client performing a PATCH operation on the Manager resource with the If-Match header
will likely contain an old ETag if DateTime is not omitted from ETag calculations, causing the service to respond with
the HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status code. However, omitting a property from ETag calculations might be
problematic for clients using the If-Match-None header to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network.
For example, if the Reading property is omitted from the ETag calculation in a Sensor resource, a client using the
If-Match-None header for GET operations could continually get the HTTP 304 Not Modified status code regardless
of how much the sensor reading changed. In this case, other methods to reduce the frequency of ETag changes are
preferred.
6.6 Protocol version
The protocol version is separate from the resources' version or the Redfish schema version that the resources
support.
Each Redfish protocol version is strongly typed by using the URI of the Redfish service in combination with the
resource obtained at that URI, called the ServiceRoot resource.
The root URI for this version of the Redfish protocol shall be /redfish/v1/ .
The URI defines the major version of the protocol.
The RedfishVersion property of the ServiceRoot resource defines the protocol version, which includes the major
version, minor version, and errata version of the protocol, as defined in the Redfish schema for that resource.
The protocol version is a string in the format:
<MajorVersion>.<MinorVersion>.<ErrataVersion>
where
â¢ <MajorVersion> is an integer that represents the major version. Indicates a backward-incompatible change.
â¢ <MinorVersion> is an integer that represents the minor version. Indicates a minor update. Redfish introduces
functionality but does not remove any functionality. The minor version preserves compatibility with earlier minor
versions.
â¢ <ErrataVersion> is an integer that represents the errata version. Indicates a fix to the earlier version.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
36 Published Version 1.23.0
Any resource that a client discovers through hyperlinks that the service root or any service root-referenced service or
resource returns shall conform to the same protocol version that the service root supports.
A GET operation on the /redfish resource shall return this response body:
```
{
```
"v1": "/redfish/v1/"
```
}
```
6.7 Redfish-defined URIs and relative reference rules
Table 4 describes the Redfish-defined URIs. Redfish services shall support URIs in the table if the Required column
contains Yes. Redfish services should support URIs in the table if the Required column contains No.

```
7.2 GET (read requests)
```
```
7.2.1 GET (read requests) overview
```
The GET operation retrieves resources from a Redfish service. Clients make a GET request to the individual
resource URI. Clients may obtain the resource URI from published sources, such as the OpenAPI document, or from
a resource identifier property in a previously retrieved resource response, such as the links property.
The service shall return the resource representation using one of the media types listed in the Accept header,
subject to the requirements of the media types. If the Accept header is absent, the service shall return the
resource's representation as application/json . Services may but are not required to support the convention of
Redfish Specification DSP0266
42 Published Version 1.23.0
retrieving individual properties within a resource by appending a segment containing the property name to the URI of
the resource.
â¢ The HTTP GET operation shall retrieve a resource without causing any side effects.
â¢ The service shall ignore the content of the body on a GET .
â¢ The GET operation shall be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource.
If supported by the service, clients can perform a conditional GET operation by specifying an If-None-Match request
header that contains the ETag of the resource.
7.2.2 Resource collection requests
Clients retrieve a resource collection by making a GET request to the resource collection URI. The response includes
the resource collection's properties and an array of its members.
No requirements are placed on implementations to return a consistent set of members when a series of requests that
use paging query parameters are made over time to obtain the entire set of members. These calls can result in
missed or duplicate elements if multiple GET requests use paging to retrieve the Members array instances.
â¢ Clients shall not make assumptions about the URIs for the members of a resource collection.
```
â¢ Retrieved resource collections shall always include the count ( Members@odata.count ) property to specify the total
```
number of entries in its Members array.
```
â¢ Regardless of the next link ( Members@odata.nextLink ) property or paging, the count ( Members@odata.count )
```
property shall return the total number of resources that the Members array references.
A subset of the members can be retrieved using client paging query parameters.
A service might not be able to return all of the contents of a resource collection request in a single response body. In
this case, the response can be paged by the service. If a service pages a response to a resource collection request,
the following rules shall apply:
â¢ Responses can contain a subset of the full resource collection's members.
â¢ Individual members shall not be split across response bodies.
```
â¢ A next link ( Members@odata.nextLink ) property annotation shall be supplied in the response body with the URI to
```
the next set of members in the collection.
```
â¢ The next link ( Members@odata.nextLink ) property shall adhere to the rules in the Next link property clause.
```
```
â¢ GET operations on the next link ( Members@odata.nextLink ) property shall return the subsequent section of the
```
resource collection response.
7.2.3 Service root request
The root URL for Redfish version 1.x services shall be /redfish/v1/ .
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 43
The service returns the ServiceRoot resource, as defined by this specification, as a response for the root URL.
Services shall not require authentication to retrieve the service root and /redfish resources.
7.2.4 OData service and metadata document requests
Redfish services expose two OData-defined documents at specific URIs to enable generic OData clients to navigate
the Redfish service.
â¢ Service shall expose an OData metadata document at the /redfish/v1/$metadata URI.
â¢ Service shall expose an OData service document at the /redfish/v1/odata URI.
â¢ Service shall not require authentication to retrieve the OData metadata document or the OData service
document.
7.3 Query parameters
7.3.1 Query parameter overview
To paginate, retrieve subsets of resources, or expand the results in a single response, clients can include the query
parameters. Some query parameters apply only to resource collections.
```
Services:
```
â¢ Shall only support query parameters on GET operations.
â¢ Should support the $top , $skip , only , and excerpt query parameters.
â¢ May support the $expand , $filter , and $select query parameters.
â¢ Shall include the ProtocolFeaturesSupported object in the service root, if the service supports query parameters.
â¦ This object indicates which parameters and options have been implemented.
â¢ Shall ignore unknown or unsupported query parameters that do not begin with $ .
â¢ Shall use the & operator to separate multiple query parameters in a single request.
â¢ Should ignore the = character if provided as the last character for the only , excerpt ,
includeoriginofcondition query parameters.
â¢ Should treat the names of query parameters as case-insensitive strings.
Services shall return:
â¢ The HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code for any unsupported query parameters that start with $ .
â¢ An extended error that indicates the unsupported query parameters for this resource.
â¢ The HTTP 400 Bad Request status code for any query parameters that contain values that are invalid, or values
applied to query parameters without defined values, such as excerpt or only .
Redfish Specification DSP0266
44 Published Version 1.23.0
Services should return:
â¢ The HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with the QueryNotSupportedOnResource message
from the Base Message Registry for any implemented query parameters that are not supported on a resource in
the request.
â¢ The HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with the QueryNotSupportedOnResource message
from the Base Message Registry for any supported query parameters that apply only to resource collections but
are used on singular resources. This includes query parameters such as $filter , $top , $skip , and only .
â¢ The HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with the QueryNotSupportedOnOperation
message from the Base Message Registry for any supported query parameters on operations other than GET .
Services shall process query parameters in this order:
â¢ $filter
â¢ $skip
â¢ $top
â¢ Apply server-side pagination
â¢ $expand
â¢ excerpt
â¢ $select
Table 7 describes the query parameters:
Table 7 â Query parameters
Query parameter Description and example
excerpt
Returns a subset of the resource's properties that match the defined Excerpt schema annotation.
If no Excerpt schema annotation is defined for the resource, the entire resource is returned.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resource?excerpt
```
$expand=<string>
Returns a hyperlink and its contents in-line with retrieved resources, as if a GET call response was
included in-line with that hyperlink.
See The $expand query parameter.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resource?$expand=*($levels=3)
```
```
https://resourcecollection?$expand=.($levels=1)
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 45
Query parameter Description and example
$filter=<string>
Applies to resource collections. Returns a subset of collection members that match the $filter
expression.
See The $filter query parameter.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resourcecollection?$filter=SystemType eq 'Physical'
```
only
Applies to resource collections. If the target resource collection contains exactly one member, clients can
use this query parameter to return that member's resource.
If the collection contains either zero members or more than one member, the response returns the
resource collection, as expected.
Services should return the HTTP 400 Bad Request and an error response with the
QueryCombinationInvalid message from the Base Message Registry if only is being combined with other
query parameters.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resourcecollection?only
```
$select=<string>
Returns a subset of the resource's properties that match the $select expression.
See The $select query parameter.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resource?$select=SystemType,Status
```
$skip=<integer>
Applies to resource collections. Returns a subset of the members in a resource collection, or an empty set
of members if the $skip value is greater than or equal to the member count. This paging query parameter
defines the number of members in the resource collection to skip.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resourcecollection?$skip=5
```
$top=<integer>
Applies to resource collections. Defines the number of members to show in the response.
Minimum value is 0 , though a value of 0 returns an empty set of members.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resourcecollection?$top=30
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266
46 Published Version 1.23.0
Query parameter Description and example
includeoriginofcondition
Returns the resource referenced by any OriginOfCondition properties in-line with the requested resource
if not inside a Links property. Can be considered a specialized type of $expand=. specifically for
OriginOfCondition properties.
```
Example:
```
```
https://resource?includeoriginofcondition
```
Services may support OEM-defined query parameters. OEM-defined query parameter names shall not contain
characters that conflict with syntax for query parameter parsing, such as & . OEM-defined query parameters shall be
in the form:
OEM-<OemIdentifier>-<ParameterName>
where
â¢ <OemIdentifier> is the unique identifier of the OEM, including possible subdivisioning, that follows the same
```
naming as defined in the OEM-specified object naming clause. Separator underscores ( _ ) may be excluded for
```
improved readability.
â¢ <ParameterName> is the parameter name.
For example, if Contoso defined a StatusOnly parameter, the query parameter would be OEM-Contoso-StatusOnly .
7.3.2 The $expand query parameter
The $expand query parameter enables a client to request a response that includes not only the requested resource,
but also includes the contents of the subordinate or hyperlinked resources. The definition of this query parameter
follows the OData Protocol Specification.
The $expand query parameter has a set of possible options that determine which hyperlinks in a resource are
included in the expanded response.
Table 9 describes the Redfish-supported options for the $expand query parameter. The service may implement
some of these options but not others. Any other supported syntax for $expand is outside the scope of this
specification.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 47
Table 8 â The $expand query parameter options
Option Description Example
```
asterisk ( * )
```
Shall expand all hyperlinks, including those in payload
annotations, such as @Redfish.Settings ,
@Redfish.ActionInfo , and
@Redfish.CollectionCapabilities .
```
https://resource?$expand=*
```
$levels
Number of levels the service should cascade the $expand
operation.
The default level shall be 1.
For example, $levels=2 expands both the hyperlinks in the
```
current resource (level 1), and the hyperlinks in the resulting
```
```
expanded resources (level 2).
```
```
https://resourcecollection?$expand=.($levels=2)
```
```
period ( . )
```
Shall expand all hyperlinks not in any links property
instances of the resource, including those in payload
annotations, such as @Redfish.Settings ,
@Redfish.ActionInfo , and
@Redfish.CollectionCapabilities .
```
https://resourcecollection?$expand=.
```
```
tilde ( ~ ) Shall expand all hyperlinks found in all links propertyinstances of the resource. https://resourcecollection?$expand=~
```
Examples of $expand usage include:
â¢ Get all members of the software inventory collection.
With $expand , the client can request multiple SoftwareInventory collection member resources in one request
rather than fetching them one at a time.
Example request: GET /redfish/v1/UpdateService/FirmwareInventory?$expand=.
â¢ Get a computer system and subordinate resources.
With $levels , a single GET request can include the subordinate resource collections, such as Processors and
Memory .
```
Example request: GET /redfish/v1/Systems/1?$expand=.($levels=3)
```
â¢ Get all UUIDs of the members of the computer system collection.
To accomplish this result, include both $select and $expand on the URI. When combining $select and
$expand , the full property path from the expansion source is required in the $select query parameter.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
48 Published Version 1.23.0
```
Example request: GET /redfish/v1/Systems?$select=Members/UUID&$expand=.($levels=1)
```
When services execute $expand , they should include all supported properties in the requested resources.
When clients use $expand , they should be aware that the payload may increase beyond what can be sent in a single
response.
If a client does not have the privileges required to access referenced resources in an expansion request, the service
shall not expand the referenced resources. Services should not fail the request if the client has the privilges to
access the URI of the requested resource.
If a service cannot return the payload due to its size, it shall return the HTTP 507 Insufficient Storage status code.
If a service cannot return the payload corresponding to an individual member of a resource collection, but can return
other members, it should:
â¢ Return the HTTP 200 OK status code.
â¢ Return the @odata.id property for the member that it cannot expand in the Members array.
â¢ Return extended information with the member indicating the reason that member was not returned, such as
when a provider internal to the service returns an error or times out.
Responses may automatically include expanded resources due to the expanded resource annotation on reference
properties, such as the Members property in the LogEntryCollection resource. $expand operates in parallel to the
usage of this schema annotation. For example, since Members is automatically expanded, the following three
requests produce identical responses:
â¢ /redfish/v1/Systems/1/LogServices/FaultLog/Entries
â¢ /redfish/v1/Systems/1/LogServices/FaultLog/Entries?$expand=.
```
â¢ /redfish/v1/Systems/1/LogServices/FaultLog/Entries?$expand=.($levels=1)
```
The following example expands the RoleCollection resource with the level set to 1:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles",
"@odata.type": "#RoleCollection.RoleCollection",
"Name": "Roles Collection",
"Members@odata.count": 3,
"Members": [
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles/Administrator",
"@odata.type": "#Role.v1_1_0.Role",
"Id": "Administrator",
"Name": "User Role",
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 49

```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles/Operator",
"@odata.type": "#Role.v1_1_0.Role",
"Id": "Operator",
"Name": "User Role",

"Id": "ReadOnly",
"Name": "User Role",
"Description": "ReadOnly User Role",
"IsPredefined": true,
"AssignedPrivileges": [ "Login", "ConfigureSelf" ]
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
7.3.3 The $select query parameter
The $select query parameter indicates that the implementation should return a subset of the resource's properties
that match the $select expression. If a request omits the $select query parameter, the response returns all
properties by default. The definition of this query parameter follows the OData Protocol Specification.
The $select expression shall not affect the resource itself.
The $select expression defines a comma-separated list of properties to return in the response body.
The syntax for properties in objects or properties in arrays of objects shall be the object and property names
```
concatenated with a slash ( / ). For arrays, the expression shall not contain the array index.
```
An example of $select usage is:
GET /redfish/v1/Systems/1?$select=Name,SystemType,Status/State
For successful responses, when services execute $select , they shall return all requested properties of the
Redfish Specification DSP0266
50 Published Version 1.23.0
referenced resource that are supported. Services shall omit unsupported properties requested in the $select query
parameter from the response. If a requested property is an object, the service shall return the entire object. The
@odata.id and @odata.type properties shall be in the response payload and contain the same values as if $select
was omitted. If the @odata.context property is supported, it shall be in the response payload and should be in the
context property recommended format. If the @odata.etag property is supported, it shall be in the response payload
and contain the same values as if $select was omitted. Services may include object-level messages or messages
for requested properties in the response payload.
For unsuccessful responses, the response body shall contain an error response regardless of the properties
requested in the $select query parameter.
Any other supported syntax for $select is outside the scope of this specification.
7.3.4 The $filter query parameter
The $filter parameter enables a client to request a subset of the resource collection's members based on the
$filter expression. The definition of this query parameter follows the OData Protocol Specification.
The $filter query parameter defines a set of properties and literals with an operator.
A literal value can be:
â¢ A string enclosed in single quotes.
â¢ A number.
â¢ A boolean value.
If the literal value does not match the data type for the specified property, the service should reject $filter requests
with the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.
The $filter section of the OData ABNF Components Specification contains the grammar for the allowable syntax
of the $filter query parameter, with the additional restriction that only built-in filter operations are supported.
Table 10 lists the Redfish-supported values for the $filter query parameter. Any other supported syntax for
$filter is outside the scope of this specification.
Table 9 â The $filter query parameter options
Value Description Example
```

ne Not equal comparisonoperator. SystemType ne 'Physical'
```
not Logical negation operator. not (ProcessorSummary/Count eq 2)
```
or Logical or operator. ProcessorSummary/Count eq 2 or ProcessorSummary/Count eq 4
When evaluating expressions, services shall use the following operator precedence:
â¢ Grouping
â¢ Logical negation
â¢ Relational comparison. gt , ge , lt , and le all have equal precedence.
â¢ Equality comparison. eq and ne both have equal precedence.
â¢ Logical and
â¢ Logical or
If the service receives an unsupported $filter query parameter, it shall reject the request and return the HTTP 501
Not Implemented status code.
7.4 HEAD
The HEAD method differs from the GET method in that it shall not return message body information.
However, the HEAD method completes the same authorization checks and returns all the same meta information and
status codes in the HTTP headers as a GET method.
Services may support the HEAD method to:
â¢ Return meta information in the form of HTTP response headers.
â¢ Verify hyperlink validity.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
52 Published Version 1.23.0
Services may support the HEAD method to verify resource accessibility.
Services shall not support any other use of the HEAD method.
The HEAD method shall be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource.
Services shall reject HEAD requests that contain query parameters. Services should return the HTTP 400 Bad
Request status code if provided with a query parameter in a HEAD request.
7.5 Data modification requests
7.5.1 Data modification requests overview
To create, modify, and delete resources, clients issue the following operations:
```
â¢ POST (create)
```
```
â¢ PATCH (update)
```
```
â¢ PUT (replace)
```
```
â¢ DELETE (delete)
```
```
â¢ POST (action) on the resource
```
The following clauses describe the success and error response requirements common to all data modification
requests.
7.5.2 Modification success responses
```
For POST (create) operations, the response from the service, after the create request succeeds, should be one of
```
these responses:
â¢ The HTTP 201 Created status code. If a response body is provided, it contains the JSON representation of the
newly created resource after the request has been applied.
â¢ The HTTP 202 Accepted status code with a Location header set to the URI of a task monitor when the
processing of the request requires additional time to be completed.
â¦ After processing of the task is complete, the created resource may be returned in response to a request to
the task monitor URI with the HTTP 201 Created status code.
â¢ The HTTP 204 No Content status code with no response body.
```
For PATCH (update), PUT (replace), and DELETE (delete) operations, the response from the service, after
```
successful modification, should be one of the following responses:
â¢ The HTTP 200 OK status code with a body that contains the JSON representation of the targeted resource after
the modification has been applied, or, for the delete operation, a representation of the deleted resource.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 53
â¢ The HTTP 202 Accepted status code with a Location header set to the URI of a task monitor when the
processing of the modification requires additional time.
â¦ After processing of the task is complete, the modified resource may be returned in response to a request to
the task monitor URI with the HTTP 200 OK status code.
â¢ The HTTP 204 No Content status code with no response body.
```
For details on successful responses to action requests, see POST (action).
```
7.5.3 Modification error responses
If the resource exists but does not support the requested operation, services shall return the HTTP 405 Method Not
Allowed status code.
Otherwise, if the service returns a client 4XX or service 5XX status code, the service encountered an error and the
resource shall not have been modified or created as a result of the operation.
```
7.6 PATCH (update)
```
To update a resource's properties, the service shall support the PATCH method.
The request body defines the changes to make to one or more properties in the resource that the request URI
references. The PATCH request does not change any properties that are not in the request body. Services may
accept a PATCH method with an empty JSON object, which indicates that the service should make no changes to the
resource.
For resources that allow for properties to not be updated immediately, clients can perform PATCH requests to a
designated settings resource. For more information, see the Settings resource clause.
See the Modification success responses clause for behavior when the PATCH operation is successful.
If supported by the service, clients can perform a conditional PATCH operation by specifying an If-Match or If-
None-Match request header that contains the ETag of the resource.
Services may reject the update on certain properties based on their own policies and, in this case, not make the
requested update. Services should not require clients to provide properties other than those the client is attempting to
modify, including the Oem property.
A partial success of a PATCH operation occurs when a modification request for multiple properties results in at least
one property updated successfully, but one or more properties could not be updated. In these cases, the service
shall return the HTTP 200 OK status code and a resource representation with extended information that lists the
properties that could not be updated. Examples include:
â¢ A property is read-only, unknown, or unsupported.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
54 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ A service-side error occurred, such as a write failure for an EEPROM.
If all properties in the update request are read-only, unknown, or unsupported, but the resource can be updated, the
service shall return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with messages that show the non-
updatable properties.
The service shall ignore OData annotations in the request body, such as the resource identifier, type, and ETag
properties, except for the conditions listed below. If the update request only contains OData annotations, the service
shall return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with the NoOperation message from the
```
Base Message Registry (preferred) or a modification success response, except for the conditions listed below.
```
â¢ Writable reference properties.
â¢ In deep operations when specifying subordinate resources.
In the absence of outside changes to the resource, the PATCH operation should be idempotent, although the original
ETag value may no longer match.
7.7 PATCH on array properties
The Array properties clause describes the three styles of array properties in a resource.
```
Within a PATCH request, the service shall accept null to remove an element, and accept an empty object {} to
```
leave an element unchanged. Array properties that use the fixed or variable length style remove those elements,
while array properties that use the rigid style replace removed elements with null elements. A service may indicate
the maximum size of an array by padding null elements at the end of the array sequence.
When processing a PATCH request, the order of operations shall be:
â¢ Modifications
â¢ Deletions
â¢ Additions
A PATCH request with fewer elements than in the current array shall remove the remaining elements of the array.
For example, a fixed length-style Flavors array indicates that the service supports a maximum of six elements, by
padding the array with null elements, with four populated.
```
{
```
"Flavors": ["Chocolate", "Vanilla", "Mango", "Strawberry", null, null]
```
}
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 55
A client could issue the following PATCH request to remove Vanilla , replace Strawberry with Cherry , and add
Coffee and Banana to the array, while leaving the other elements unchanged.
```
{
```
```
"Flavors": [{}, null, {}, "Cherry", "Coffee", "Banana"]
```
```
}
```
After the PATCH operation, the resulting array is:
```
{
```
"Flavors": ["Chocolate", "Mango", "Cherry", "Coffee", "Banana", null]
```
}
```
```
7.8 PUT (replace)
```
To completely replace a resource, services may support the PUT method. The service may add properties to the
response resource that the client omits from the request body, the resource definition requires, or the service
normally supplies.
The PUT operation should be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource, with the possible
exception that the operation might change ETag values.
See the Modification success responses clause for behavior when the PUT operation is successful.
If supported by the service, clients can perform a conditional PUT operation by specifying an If-Match or If-None-
Match request header that contains the ETag of the resource.
```
Services may reject requests that do not include properties that the resource definition (schema) requires.
```
```
7.9 POST (create)
```
To create a resource, services shall support the POST method on resource collections.
The POST request is submitted to the resource collection to which the new resource will belong. See the Modification
success responses clause for behavior when the POST operation is successful.
The body of the create request contains a representation of the object to create. The service may ignore any service-
controlled properties, such as Id , which would force the service to overwrite those properties. Additionally, the
service shall set the Location header in the response to the URI of the new resource.
â¢ Submitting a POST request to a resource collection is equivalent to submitting the same request to the Members
Redfish Specification DSP0266
56 Published Version 1.23.0
property of that resource collection. Services that support the addition of Members to a resource collection shall
support both forms.
â¦ For example, if a client adds a member to the resource collection at /redfish/v1/EventService/
Subscriptions , it can perform a POST request to either /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions or
/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/Members .
â¢ The POST operation shall not be idempotent.
â¢ Services may allow the inclusion of the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime property in the request body. See
Operation apply time.
â¢ Services should return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code for requests containing properties with the value
null .
â¢ Services should not require clients to provide properties that are not annotated as required on create.
```
7.10 DELETE (delete)
```
To remove a resource, the service shall support the DELETE method. Resources subordinate to the resource
removed by a DELETE method are typically removed, as the contents of subordinate resources are dependent on the
parent resource. In some cases, related resources may also be relocated in the resource tree based on their
definition and usage. Other resources in the resource tree may also be removed or incur side effects of a resource
removal.
See the Modification success responses clause for behavior when the DELETE operation is successful.
â¢ If the resource was already deleted, the service may return the HTTP 404 Not Found status code or a success
code.
â¢ The service may allow the inclusion of the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime property in the request body. See
Operation apply time.
```
7.11 POST (action)
```
Services shall support the POST method as a way for clients to send actions to resources.
â¢ The POST operation may not be idempotent.
â¢ Services may allow the inclusion of the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime property in the request body. See
Operation apply time.
â¢ Services should not require clients to provide parameters that are not annotated as required.
To request actions on a resource, send the HTTP POST method to the URI of the action. The target property in the
resource's Actions property shall contain the URI of the action. The URI of the action shall be in the format:
<ResourceUri>/Actions/<QualifiedActionName>
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 57
where
â¢ <ResourceUri> is the URI of the resource that supports the action.
â¢ Actions is the name of the property that contains the actions for a resource, as defined by this specification.
â¢ <QualifiedActionName> is the qualified name of the action. Includes the resource type.
To determine the available actions and the valid parameter values for those actions, clients can query a resource
directly.
Clients provide parameters for the action as a JSON object within the request body of the POST operation. For
information about the structure of the request and required parameters, see the Actions property clause. Some
parameter information may require that the client examine the Redfish schema that corresponds to the resource.
If the action request does not contain all required parameters, the service shall return the HTTP 400 Bad Request
status code. If the action request contains unsupported parameters, the service shall ignore the unsupported
parameters or return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. If an action does not have any required parameters,
the service shall accept an empty JSON object in the HTTP body for the action request.
```
Note: Previous versions of the specification allowed a service to reject action requests with an empty JSON
```
object in the HTTP body if the client is not providing parameters for the action request. Services implementing
version v1.20.0 or higher are required to accept an empty JSON object in an action request when the client is
not providing parameters for the action request.
Table 10 describes the HTTP status codes and additional information that the service shall return a response to a
```
successful POST (action) request:
```
```

Additional time is required to process. 202 Accepted A Location response header set to the URI of a task monitor.
Success, and the action's schema
definition does not contain an action
response.
204 No Content No response body.
If an action requested by the client has no effect, such as a reset of a ComputerSystem where the ResetType
parameter is set to On and the ComputerSystem is already On , the service should respond with the HTTP 200 OK
status code and return the NoOperation message from the Base Message Registry.
If an error was detected and the action request was not processed, the service shall return an HTTP 4XX or HTTP
5XX status code. The response body, if provided, shall contain an error response that describes the error or errors.
Example successful action response:
```
{
```
```
"error": {
```
"code": "Base.1.8.Success",
"message": "Successfully Completed Request",
```
"@Message.ExtendedInfo": [{
```
"@odata.type": "#Message.v1_1_1.Message",
"MessageId": "Base.1.8.Success",
"Message": "Successfully Completed Request",
"Severity": "OK",
"MessageSeverity": "OK",
"Resolution": "None"
```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
7.12 Operation apply time
Services may accept the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime annotation in the following request bodies:
```
â¢ POST (create)
```
```
â¢ DELETE (delete)
```
```
â¢ POST (action)
```
â¢ The JSON part for multipart HTTP POST operations, such as with the multipart HTTP push update in the update
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 59
service.
This annotation enables the client to control when an operation is carried out.
For example, if the client wants to delete a particular Volume resource, but can only safely do so when a reset
occurs, the client can use this annotation to instruct the service to delete the Volume on the next reset.
If multiple operations are pending, the service shall process them in the order in which the service receives them.
Services that support the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime annotation for create operations on a resource collection and
delete operations on members of a resource collection shall include the @Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport
response annotation for the resource collection.
The following example is a response for a resource collection that supports the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime
annotation in requests to create new members and delete existing members:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Storage/SATAEmbedded/Volumes",
"@odata.type": "#VolumeCollection.VolumeCollection",
"Name": "Storage Volume Collection",
"Description": "Storage Volume Collection",
"Members@odata.count": 2,
```
"Members": [{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Storage/SATAEmbedded/Volumes/1"
```
}, {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Storage/SATAEmbedded/Volumes/2"
```
}],
```
```
"@Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport": {
```
"@odata.type": "#Settings.v1_3_3.OperationApplyTimeSupport",
"SupportedValues": ["Immediate", "OnReset"]
```
}
```
```
}
```
In the previous example, a client can annotate their create request body on the VolumeCollection itself, or a delete
operation on the Volumes within the VolumeCollection .
The following sample request deletes a Volume on the next reset:
DELETE /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Storage/SATAEmbedded/Volumes/2 HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0
```
{
```
"@Redfish.OperationApplyTime": "OnReset"
Redfish Specification DSP0266
60 Published Version 1.23.0
```
}
```
Services that support the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime annotation for an action shall include the
@Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport response annotation for the action.
The following example is a response for a ComputerSystem resource that supports the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime
annotation in the reset action request:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1",
"@odata.type": "#ComputerSystem.v1_5_0.ComputerSystem",
```
"Actions": {
```
```
"#ComputerSystem.Reset": {
```
"target": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset",
"ResetType@Redfish.AllowableValues": ["On", "ForceOff", "ForceRestart",
"Nmi", "ForceOn", "PushPowerButton"],
```
"@Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport": {
```
"@odata.type": "#Settings.v1_3_3.OperationApplyTimeSupport",
"SupportedValues": ["Immediate", "AtMaintenanceWindowStart"],
"MaintenanceWindowStartTime": "2017-05-03T23:12:37-05:00",
"MaintenanceWindowDurationInSeconds": 600,
```
"MaintenanceWindowResource": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1"
```
}
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
In the previous example, a client can annotate their reset action request body on the ComputerSystem in the payload.
The following sample request completes a reset at the start of the next maintenance window:
POST /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0
```
{
```
"ResetType": "ForceRestart",
"@Redfish.OperationApplyTime": "AtMaintenanceWindowStart"
```
}
```
Services that support the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime annotation for the JSON part of a multipart HTTP POST
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 61
operation shall include the @Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport response annotation for the property that specifies
the URI of the multipart POST operation.
The following example is a response for an UpdateService resource that supports the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime
annotation in the JSON part of a multipart request:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/UpdateService",
"@odata.type": "#UpdateService.v1_8_0.UpdateService",
"MultipartHttpPushUri": "/redfish/v1/UpdateService/update-multipart",
```
"MultipartHttpPushUri@Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport": {
```
"@odata.type": "#Settings.v1_3_3.OperationApplyTimeSupport",
"SupportedValues": ["Immediate", "AtMaintenanceWindowStart"],
"MaintenanceWindowStartTime": "2017-05-03T23:12:37-05:00",
"MaintenanceWindowDurationInSeconds": 600,
```
"MaintenanceWindowResource": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/UpdateService"
```
}
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
Services that support the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime annotation for a resource collection, action, or multipart
HTTP POST operation shall create a task, and respond with the HTTP 202 Accepted status code with a Location
header set to the URI of a task monitor, if the client's request body contains @Redfish.OperationApplyTime in the
request.
The Settings Redfish schema defines the structure of the @Redfish.OperationApplyTimeSupport object and the
@Redfish.OperationApplyTime annotation value.
7.13 Deep operations
Implementations may support operations that modify the current resource as well as subordinate resources. These
operations are known as deep operations. They give the client the ability to modify more than one resource with a
single operation.
Table 11 describes the types of deep operations that this specification defines:
Table 11 â Deep operations
Operation Description Example
```
Deep PATCH (update) Modify a resource and one or more subordinateresources.
```
Modify a ComputerSystem resource as well as
subordinate Storage and NetworkInterface
resources.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
62 Published Version 1.23.0
Operation Description Example
```
Deep POST (create) Create one or more resources in a resource collectionand optionally subordinate resources. Create multiple ManagerAccount resources.
```
â¢ Services that support deep PATCH for updating resources shall set the value of the DeepPATCH property in the
DeepOperations property in the ProtocolFeaturesSupported property within the service root to true .
â¢ Services that support deep POST for creating resources shall set the value of the DeepPOST property in the
DeepOperations property in the ProtocolFeaturesSupported property within the service root to true .
â¢ The Members property in resource collections shall not be removed when using a deep PATCH .
â¢ Action URIs shall not support deep POST operations.
â¢ If the service supports deep operations, the MaxLevels property in the DeepOperations property in the
ProtocolFeaturesSupported property in the service root shall indicate the maximum number of levels that the
service supports for deep operations.
â¢ To request deep operations on a resource, send the HTTP method to the deep operation URI of the resource.
The URI for deep operations on any resource shall be in the format: <ResourceUri>.Deep .
â¢ The schema used for validating the root level of the request body shall be the schema of the resource in the
resource URI.
â¦ The subordinate resources included in the request body shall be validated against their corresponding
schema.
The body of deep operations contains the resource being modified as well as the subordinate resources being
modified. This resource can be a collection or a single instance. These resources could be subordinate resources,
subordinate resource collections, or subordinate members of resource collections. The client can omit properties
from the request such as those it does not want to modify or that the service controls. Requests that include
references to multiple instances, such as members of a collection, shall include the Members property as part of the
request body.
To determine which members of subordinate resource collections are to be modified by a deep PATCH , services shall
use the @odata.id property provided by the client to identify the member of the resource collection to be modified.
Clients may provide the @odata.etag property in subordinate resources being modified by a deep PATCH . If the
request contains the If-Match or If-None-Match header, the service shall compare the ETag in the request header
with the ETag of the resource specified by the URI. If this check passes, the operation can proceed using the
@odata.etag values contained in the body of the subordinate resources. In this case, the operation on each
subordinate resource shall be completed independently, where some subordinate values that pass the condition
check proceed and the resources that fail do not proceed. In this case, annotated extended information shall be
included in the subordinate resource representation of the response.
Failure semantics for deep operations are similar to that of other operations of similar type. If any properties in a
deep PATCH operation succeeded, the result is a 200 OK with the results returned in the response, and the service
should include extended information indicating warnings or errors. For a deep POST operation, if any member of the
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 63
collection was created then a 201 Created shall be returned, and any members that were not created should have
extended information in their place holders with sufficient identifying information, such as returning all of the
properties provided in the POST request body for that member, as well as extended information indicating why the
creation was not successful. When sending a deep POST request, the value of the Location header shall be that of
one of the URIs created and should be that of one of the least subordinate URIs, such as that of a ComputerSystem
resource and not one of the devices subordinate to the ComputerSystem resource.
If the request body for a deep operation contains resources that are not modifiable, but no modifications are
requested for those resources, services shall not treat this as a modification request for those resources. For
example, if the service root is not modifiable, meaning PATCH is not accepted on the resource, a client is allowed to
provide the service root in the deep operation request body if there are no modifications to the service root.
Deep POST shall not be allowed on the SessionCollection resource.
The following deep PATCH example modifies two members of the RoleCollection resource:
PATCH /redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles.Deep HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0
```
{
```
"Members": [
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles/OperatorRestricted",

```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles/ReadOnlyRestricted",
"AssignedPrivileges": [ "Login" ]
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
The following deep POST example creates two members in the RoleCollection resource:
POST /redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles.Deep HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0

```
},
```
```
{
```
"RoleId": "ReadOnlyRestricted",
"AssignedPrivileges": [ "Login" ]
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
The following deep POST example creates one member in the EventDestinationCollection resource and creates a
Certificate resource subordinate to the new EventDestination resource:
POST /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions.Deep HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0

"CertificateType": "PEM",
"CertificateString": "----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ...."
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
The following deep PATCH example modifies the asset tag and BIOS settings of a ComputerSystem resource:
PATCH /redfish/v1/Systems/47832.Deep HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0
```
{
```
"AssetTag": "Inventory Tag 12394783431",

```
"BootMode": "Uefi"
```
}
```
```
}

```
}
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
The following example shows a deep PATCH with ETags in the request:
PATCH /redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles.Deep HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
If-Match: <Collection ETag>

"@odata.etag": "W/\"ABCDEFG\"",
"AssignedPrivileges": [ "Login" ]
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
The following example response shows a partial failure of a deep PATCH where the ETag provided in the request for
the Role resource named ReadOnlyRestricted was incorrect:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

8 Service responses
This clause describes the responses that Redfish services can return to clients.
8.1 Response headers
Table 12 lists the HTTP response headers and their requirements for Redfish services and clients.
â¢ Redfish services shall include in HTTP responses the HTTP headers in Table 12 if the Required column
contains Yes.
â¢ Redfish services should include in HTTP responses the HTTP headers in Table 12 if the Required column
contains No.
â¢ Redfish clients shall be able to both understand and process all HTTP headers in Table 12.
â¢ Redfish clients shall process all HTTP header names in a case-insensitive manner.
Table 12 â Response headers
Header Required Supported values Description
Access-Control-Allow-Origin No Fetch Living Standard,3.2.3. HTTP responsesPrevents or allows requests based on originating domain.Prevents CSRF attacks.
Allow Yes POST , PUT , PATCH ,DELETE , GET , HEAD
```
Shall be returned with the HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed)
```
status code to indicate the valid methods for the request URI.
```
Shall be returned with the HTTP 200 (OK) status code with
```
any GET or HEAD operation to indicate the other allowable
operations for this resource.
Cache-Control Yes RFC7234 Shall be supported and indicates whether a response can orcannot be cached.
Content-Encoding No RFC7231 Encoding used to compress the message body.
Content-Length No RFC7231
Size of the message body. An optional means of indicating
size of the body uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked , that does
not use the Content-Length header. If a service does not
support Transfer-Encoding and needs Content-Length
instead, the service shall respond with the HTTP 411 Length
Required status code.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
68 Published Version 1.23.0
Header Required Supported values Description
Content-Type Yes RFC7231
The message body's representation type.
Services shall specify a Content-Type of application/json
when returning resources as JSON.
Services shall specify a Content-Type of application/xml
when returning metadata as XML.
Services shall specify a Content-Type of application/yaml
or application/vnd.oai.openapi when returning OpenAPI
schema as YAML.
Services shall specify a Content-Type of text/event-stream
when returning an SSE stream.
```
;charset=utf-8 shall be appended to the Content-Type if
```
specified in the chosen media-type in the Accept header for
the request.
ETag Conditional RFC7232
An identifier for a specific version of a resource, often a
message digest. The ETag header shall be included on
responses to GET s of ManagerAccount resources.
Link Yes RFC8288 Link headers shall be returned, as described in the Linkheaders clause.
Location Conditional RFC7231
URI of a newly created resource. Shall be returned upon
creation of a resource. Location and X-Auth-Token shall be
included on responses that create user sessions.
Max-Forwards No RFC7231 Limits gateway and proxy hops. Prevents messages fromremaining in the network indefinitely.
OData-Version Yes 4.0 OData version of the payload to which the responseconforms.
Retry-After No RFC7231, Section 7.1.3 Informs a client how long to wait before requesting the taskinformation again.
Server No RFC7231
A product token and its version. Multiple product tokens may
be listed.
```
Note: Previous versions of the Specification marked this
```
header as required. This has been changed because no use
cases for requiring it have been identified.
Via No RFC7230 Defines the network hierarchy and recognizes messageloops. Each pass inserts its own Via header.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 69
Header Required Supported values Description
WWW-Authenticate Conditional RFC7617
Provides a challenge to clients, such as directing a client to
perform HTTP Basic authentication, when authentication
headers in the request are missing or invalid. Services shall
return this header if the HTTPBasicAuth property in the
AccountService resource contains Enabled or is not
implemented.
X-Auth-Token Yes Opaque encoded octetstringsContains the authentication token for user sessions. Thetoken value shall be indistinguishable from random.
8.2 Link header
The Link header provides metadata information on the accessed resource in response to a HEAD or GET request.
The metadata information can include hyperlinks from the resource and JSON Schemas that describe the resource.
The following example shows the Link headers for a ManagerAccount with an Administrator role, in addition to a
Settings annotation:
```
Link: </redfish/v1/AccountService/Roles/Administrator>; path=/Links/Role
```
```
Link: <http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/Settings.json>
```
```
Link: </redfish/v1/JsonSchemas/ManagerAccount.v1_0_2.json>; rel=describedby
```
â¢ The first Link header is an example of a hyperlink that comes from the resource. It describes hyperlinks within
the resource. This type of header is outside the scope of this specification.
â¢ The second Link header is an example of an annotation Link header as it references the JSON Schema that
describes the annotation and does not have rel=describedby . This example references the public copy of the
annotation on DMTF's Redfish schema repository.
â¢ The third Link header is an example for the JSON Schema that describes the actual resource.
â¦ Note that the URL can reference an unversioned JSON Schema because the @odata.type in the resource
indicates the appropriate version, or reference the versioned JSON Schema, which according to previous
normative statements need to match the version in the @odata.type property of the resource.
A Link header containing rel=describedby shall be returned on GET and HEAD requests for Redfish resources. If
the referenced JSON Schema is a versioned schema, it shall match the version contained in the value of the
@odata.type property returned in this resource.
A Link header satisfying annotations should be returned on GET and HEAD requests for Redfish resources.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
70 Published Version 1.23.0
8.3 Status codes
HTTP defines status codes that appear in responses. The status codes themselves provide general information
about how the request was processed, such as whether the request was successful, if the client provided bad
information, or the service encountered an error when processing the request.
â¢ When the service returns a status code in the 4XX or 5XX range, services should return an extended error
response in the response body to provide the client more meaningful and deterministic error semantics.
â¢ When the service returns a status code in the 2XX range and the response contains a representation of a
resource, services may use extended information to convey additional information about the resource.
â¢ Extended error messages shall not provide privileged information when authentication failures occur.
```
Note: For security implications of extended errors, See Security details.
```
Table 13 lists HTTP status codes that have meaning or usage defined for a Redfish service, or are otherwise
referenced by this specification. Other codes may be returned by the service as appropriate, and their usage is
implementation-specific. For usage and additional requirements imposed by this specification, see the Description
column.
â¢ Clients shall understand and be able to process the HTTP-defined status codes in Table 13 and constrained by
additional requirements defined by this specification.
â¢ Services shall respond with the HTTP-defined status codes in Table 13 and constrained by additional
requirements in the Description column.
â¢ If no other status code in the 4XX range is appropriate for client-side errors, the default status code should be
the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.
â¢ If no other status code in the 5XX range is appropriate for service-side errors, the default status code should be
the HTTP 500 Internal Server Error status code.
Table 13 â HTTP status codes
HTTP status code Description
200 OK Request completed successfully and includes a representation in its body.
201 Created
Request to create a resource completed successfully. The Location header shall be set to the
```
canonical URI for the newly created resource. For POST (create) requests, the response body
```
```
may include a representation of the newly created resource. For POST (action) requests, the
```
response body shall include the action response.
202 Accepted
Request has been accepted for processing but the processing has not been completed. The
Location header shall be set to the URI of a task monitor that can later be queried to determine
the status of the operation. If a response body is provided, it shall contain a representation of the
Task resource.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 71
HTTP status code Description
204 No Content Request succeeded, but no response body is provided.
301 Moved Permanently Requested resource resides under a different URI.
302 Found Requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
304 Not Modified
Service has made a conditional GET request where access is allowed but the resource content
has not changed. Certain request headers, such as If-None-Match , initiate conditional requests
to save network bandwidth if no change has occurred. See HTTP 1.1, sections 14.25 and 14.26.
400 Bad Request
Request could not be processed because it contains invalid information, such as an invalid input
field, or is missing a required value. The response body shall return an extended error as
defined in the Error responses clause.
401 Unauthorized
Authentication credentials included with this request are missing or invalid. Services should
include the AccessUnauthorized message from the Base Message Registry in responses with
this status code. Additional details are described in the Sensitive data clause.
403 Forbidden
Service recognized the credentials in the request but those credentials do not possess
authorization to complete this request. This code is also returned when the user credentials
provided need to be changed before access to the service can be granted. Services should
include the InsufficientPrivilege message from the Base Message Registry in responses with
this status code. For details, see the Security details clause.
404 Not Found Request specified a URI of a resource that does not exist. Additional details are described in theSensitive data clause.
405 Method Not Allowed
HTTP verb in the request, such as DELETE , GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , or PATCH , is not
supported for this request URI. The response shall include an Allow header that provides a list
of methods that the resource identified by the URI in the client request supports. Additional
details are described in the Sensitive data clause.
406 Not Acceptable Accept header was specified in the request and the resource identified by this request cannotgenerate a representation that corresponds to one of the media types in the Accept header.
409 Conflict
Creation or update request could not be completed because it would cause a conflict in the
current state of the resources that the platform supports. For example, a conflict occurred due to
an attempt to set multiple properties that work in a linked manner by using incompatible values.
410 Gone
Requested resource is no longer available at the service and no forwarding address is known.
This condition is expected to be considered permanent. Clients with hyperlink editing capabilities
should delete references to the URI in the client request after user approval. If the service does
not know or cannot determine whether the condition is permanent, client should use the HTTP
404 Not Found status code. This response is cacheable unless otherwise indicated.
411 Length Required
Request did not use the Content-Length header to specify the length of its content but perhaps
used the Transfer-Encoding: chunked header instead. The addressed resource requires the
Content-Length header.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
72 Published Version 1.23.0
HTTP status code Description
412 Precondition Failed Precondition check, such as check of the OData-Version , If-Match , or If-None-Match header,failed.
413 Payload Too Large Request payload, or a part in a multipart request, is larger than the maximum size the servicesupports.
415 Unsupported Media Type Request specifies a Content-Type for the body that is not supported.
428 Precondition Required Request did not provide the required precondition, such as an If-Match or If-None-Matchheader.
431 Request Header Field Too Large Service is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field or thecollection of all header fields are too large.
500 Internal Server Error Service encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Theresponse body shall return an extended error as defined in the Error responses clause.
501 Not Implemented
Service does not currently support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This response
is appropriate when the service does not recognize the request method and cannot support the
method for any resource.
503 Service Unavailable
Service currently cannot handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the
service. A service may use this response to indicate that the request URI is valid but the service
is performing initialization or other maintenance on the resource. A service may also use this
response to indicate that the service itself is undergoing maintenance, such as finishing
initialization steps after reboot of the service.
507 Insufficient Storage Service cannot build the response for the client due to the size of the response.
8.4 OData metadata responses
8.4.1 OData metadata responses overview
OData metadata describes resources, resource collections, capabilities, and service-dependent behavior to generic
OData consumers with no specific understanding of this specification. Clients are not required to request metadata if
they already have sufficient understanding of the target service. For example, clients are not required to request
metadata to request and interpret a JSON representation of a resource that this specification defines.
A client can access the OData metadata at the /redfish/v1/$metadata URI.
A client can access the OData service document at the /redfish/v1/odata URI.
8.4.2 OData $metadata
The OData metadata describes top-level service resources and resource types according to OData Common
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 73
Schema Definition Language. The OData metadata is represented as an XML document with an Edmx root element
in the http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx namespace with an OData version attribute set to 4.0 .
```
The service shall use the application/xml or application/xml;charset=utf-8 MIME types to return the OData
```
metadata document as an XML document.
<edmx:Edmx xmlns:edmx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx" Version="4.0">
<!-- edmx:Reference and edmx:Schema elements go here -->
</edmx:Edmx>
8.4.2.1 Referencing other schemas
The OData metadata should include the namespaces for each of the Redfish resource types, along with the
RedfishExtensions.v1_0_0 namespace. Dynamic clients that reference the OData metadata document leverage
schema definitions that are referenced to understand the definitions of the resources in the service. However, there
are cases where it might not be practical to maintain an accurate document, such as when resources are dynamically
discovered by the service through devices that support Redfish Device Enablement.
These references shall use either:
â¢ An absolute URI for the Redfish schema definitions, such as on http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas or
```
http://developers.contoso.org/schemas .
```
â¢ A relative URI to a local copy of the Redfish schema. See the Redfish-defined URIs and relative reference rules
clause for recommended URI patterns.
<edmx:Reference Uri="http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/ServiceRoot_v1.xml">
<edmx:Include Namespace="ServiceRoot"/>
<edmx:Include Namespace="ServiceRoot.v1_0_0"/>
</edmx:Reference>
...
<edmx:Reference Uri="http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/VirtualMedia_v1.xml">
<edmx:Include Namespace="VirtualMedia"/>
<edmx:Include Namespace="VirtualMedia.v1_0_0"/>
</edmx:Reference>
<edmx:Reference Uri="http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/RedfishExtensions_v1.xml">
<edmx:Include Namespace="RedfishExtensions.v1_0_0" Alias="Redfish"/>
</edmx:Reference>
The service's OData metadata document shall include an EntityContainer that defines the top-level resources and
resource collections.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
74 Published Version 1.23.0
8.4.2.2 Referencing OEM extensions
The OData metadata document may reference additional schema documents that describe OEM-specific extensions
that the service uses.
For example, the OData metadata document may reference custom types for additional resource collections.
<edmx:Reference Uri="http://contoso.org/Schema/CustomTypes">
<edmx:Include Namespace="CustomTypes"/>
</edmx:Reference>
8.4.3 OData service document
The OData service document serves as a top-level entry point for generic OData clients. More information about the
OData service document can be found in the OData JSON Format Specification.
```
{
```
"@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata",
```
"value": [{
```
"name": "Service",
"kind": "Singleton",
"url": "/redfish/v1/"
```
}, {
```
"name": "Systems",
"kind": "Singleton",
"url": "/redfish/v1/Systems"
```
}, ...]
```
```
}
```
The service shall use the application/json MIME type to return the OData service document as a JSON object.
The JSON object shall contain the @odata.context context property set to /redfish/v1/$metadata .
The JSON object shall include a value property set to a JSON array that contains an entry for the service root and
each resource that is a direct child of the service root.
Table 14 describes the properties that each JSON object entry includes:
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 75
Table 14 â JSON object properties
Property Description
name User-friendly resource name of the resource.
kind Type of resource. Value is Singleton for all cases defined by Redfish.
url Relative URL for the top-level resource.
8.5 Resource responses
Services use the application/json MIME type to return resources and resource collections as JSON payloads. A
service shall not break responses for a single resource into multiple results.
The format of these payloads is defined by the Redfish schema. For rules about the Redfish schema and how it
maps to JSON payloads, see the Data model and Schema definition languages clauses.
8.6 Error responses
HTTP status codes often do not provide enough information to enable deterministic error semantics. For example, if
a client makes a PATCH call and some properties do not match while others are not supported, the HTTP 400 Bad
Request status code does not tell the client which values are in error. Error responses provide the client more
meaningful and deterministic error semantics.
To provide the client with as much information about the error as possible, a Redfish service may provide multiple
error responses in the HTTP response. Additionally, the service may provide Redfish standardized errors, OEM-
defined errors, or both, depending on the implementation's ability to convey the most useful information about the
underlying error.
Table 15 describes the properties in the extended error response, which is a single JSON object:
Table 15 â Error properties
Property Description
code String. Defines a MessageId from the message registry. See the MessageId format clause for the format ofMessageId .
message Displays a human-readable error message that corresponds to the message in the message registry.
@Message.ExtendedInfo Displays an array of message objects. Describes one or more error messages.
See the Schema definition languages clause for references to the schema definitions of the error response payload.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
76 Published Version 1.23.0
The @Message.ExtendedInfo property should be present in all error responses. If the @Message.ExtendedInfo property
is present, all information necessary to process the error should be provided in the @Message.ExtendedInfo property.
Clients should look for the @Message.ExtendedInfo property for error processing first, and fallback on the code and
message properties if @Message.ExtendedInfo is not present.
The following sample error response contains two messages in the @Message.ExtendedInfo property that describe
two different errors. The message described by the code and message properties do not provide actionable
information for the client.
```
{
```
```
"error": {
```
"code": "Base.1.8.GeneralError",
"message": "A general error has occurred. See Resolution for information on how to resolve the
error.",
```
"@Message.ExtendedInfo": [{
```
"@odata.type": "#Message.v1_1_1.Message",
"MessageId": "Base.1.8.PropertyValueNotInList",
"RelatedProperties": [
"/IndicatorLED"
],
"Message": "The value Red for the property IndicatorLED is not in the list of acceptable values.",
"MessageArgs": ["Red",
"IndicatorLED"
],
"Severity": "Warning",
"MessageSeverity": "Warning",
"Resolution": "Choose a value from the enumeration list that the implementation can support and
resubmit the request if the operation failed."
```
}, {
```
"@odata.type": "#Message.v1_1_1.Message",
"MessageId": "Base.1.8.PropertyNotWritable",
"RelatedProperties": [
"/SKU"],
"Message": "The property SKU is a read only property and cannot be assigned a value.",
"MessageArgs": ["SKU"],
"Severity": "Warning",
"MessageSeverity": "Warning",
"Resolution": "Remove the property from the request body and resubmit the request if the operation
failed."
```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 77
9 Data model
One of the key tenets of Redfish is the separation of protocol from the data model. This separation makes the data
```
both transport and protocol agnostic. By concentrating on the data transported in the payload of the protocol (in
```
```
HTTP, it is the HTTP body), Redfish can also define the payload in any encoding and the data model is intended to
```
be schema-language agnostic. While Redfish uses the JSON data-interchange format, Redfish provides a common
encoding type that ensures property naming conventions that make development easier in JavaScript, Python, and
other languages. This encoding type helps the Redfish data model be more easily accessible in modern tools and
programming environments.
The data model allows an OEM to extend the model by adding an OEM resource or extending a resource.
This clause describes common data model, resource, and Redfish schema requirements.
9.1 Resources
A resource is a single entity accessed at a specific URI. Services use the application/json MIME type to return
resources as JSON payloads.
Each resource shall be strongly typed, defined by a resource type in a Redfish schema document, and identified in
the response payload by the value of the type identifier property.
Responses for a single resource shall contain the following properties:
â¢ @odata.id
â¦ Registry resources are not required to provide @odata.id
â¢ @odata.type
â¢ Id
â¢ Name
Responses may also contain other properties defined within that resource type. Responses shall not include any
properties not defined by that resource type.
9.2 Resource types
A resource type defines the set of properties that may be returned in the response payload of a Redfish resource
request. Each resource type is documented in a Redfish schema document, and those documents are known
collectively as the Redfish schema. The resource type may also include definitions for actions available for that
resource.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
78 Published Version 1.23.0
Resource types are named to match the contents and purpose of the resource that they define. For example, the
Circuit resource type defines the properties and actions related to a single electrical circuit. Resource types
provide global uniqueness for definitions across multiple schema files and allow for schema files to reference each
other. Resource types may be defined by OEMs to extend the Redfish schema, and should follow the naming rules
specified by the OEM resource types clause.
9.3 Resource collections
A resource collection is a set of resources that share the same schema definition. Services use the application/
json MIME type to return resource collections as JSON payloads.
Resource collection responses shall contain the following properties:
â¢ @odata.id
â¢ @odata.type
â¢ Name
â¢ Members
â¢ Members@odata.count
Responses for resource collections may contain the following properties:
â¢ @odata.context
â¢ @odata.etag
â¢ Description
â¢ Members@odata.nextLink
â¢ Oem
Responses for resource collections shall not contain any other properties with the exception of payload annotations.
9.4 OEM resources
OEMs and other third parties can extend the Redfish data model by creating additional resource types. Extending the
data model is accomplished by defining an OEM resource type, and schema file, for each resource type, and
creating hyperlinks to connect instances of new resources to the resource tree.
Companies, OEMs, and other organizations may also use the Oem property in resources, the links property, and the
actions property to define additional properties, hyperlinks, and actions for standard Redfish resource types.
While the information and semantics of these extensions are outside of the standard, the schema representing the
data, the resource itself, and the semantics around the protocol shall conform to the requirements in this
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 79
specification. OEMs are encouraged to follow the design tenets and naming conventions in this specification when
defining OEM resources or properties.
9.5 Common data types
9.5.1 Primitive types
Table 16 describes the primitive data types for properties and action parameters in the data model:
Table 16 â Primitive data types
Type Description
Boolean A variable with a value of true or false .
Number A number with optional decimal point or exponent. Number properties may restrict the representation to an integer or anumber with decimal point.
```
String A sequence of characters enclosed with double quotes ( " ).
```
```
Array A comma-separated set of the previous types enclosed with square braces ( [ and ] ). See the Array properties clause.
```
```
Object A set of properties enclosed with curly braces ( { and } ). See the Structured properties clause.
```
Null null value, which the service uses when it is unable to determine the property's value due to an error or other temporarycondition, or if the schema has requirements for using null for other special conditions.
When receiving values from the client, services should support other valid representations of the data in the specified
JSON type. In particular, services should support valid integer and decimal values in exponential notation and integer
values that contain a decimal point with no non-zero trailing digits.
9.5.2 Enumerations
Enumerations are frequently used in Redfish to promote readability and interoperability, especially compared to the
use of string values when used for similar purposes. Enumerations aren't optimal in all cases. Properties with two
values that are likely to not have additional values should consider the boolean type if the true and false values
can be described by the property name. The following design tenets apply to enumerations:
â¢ Enumeration values can be added to existing properties. Client software should be prepared to receive
enumeration values that are not known if the resource schema version is higher than the client's supported
version.
â¢ Enumeration properties should avoid definition of "unknown", "other", or similar generic or placeholder values as
these reduce interoperability.
â¢ Feedback is encouraged for adding enumeration values to existing properties to cover new technologies or use
cases.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
80 Published Version 1.23.0
â¦ Enumeration values are generally defined to support existing or newly developed products.
â¦ Enumeration values that are obsolete or highly unlikely to appear in implementations are not included, but
they can be added.
â¦ Enumerations may include vendor-specific values when they apply to multiple products or implementations.
â¦ Sometimes the value OEM is included as an enumeration value. When this is in the enumeration, client
software should be aware that there is likely an Oem property with additional information. In some cases,
standard schema contains a standard value to further describe this enumeration value when additional OEM
data is unlikely.
9.5.3 Empty string values
```
String properties should return an empty string ("") for properties configured by a user or external service that have
```
not been set to an initial value. This allows client software to identify the property as supported by the service and
avoids the use of null , which indicates an error condition. For example, the AssetTag property must be set by the
```
end user, and therefore would return an empty string ("") until assigned a value by the user, while a failure to read the
```
stored AssetTag value due to a non-volatile memory error would return null . To improve interoperability,
implementations should avoid the use of filler strings, such as N/A or <Empty> , to represent a value not set by a
user.
9.5.4 GUID and UUID values
```
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) and Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) values are unique identifier strings and
```
shall use the RFC4122-defined format:
```
([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12})
```
9.5.5 Date-Time values
Date-Time values are strings according to the ISO 8601 extended format, including the time offset or UTC suffix.
Date-Time values shall use the format:
```
<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>T<hh>:<mm>:<ss>[.<SSS>](Z|((+|-)<HH>:<MM>))
```
where
â¢ <YYYY> is the four-digit year.
```
â¢ <MM> is the two-digit month (1 to 12).
```
```
â¢ <DD> is the two-digit day (1 to 31).
```
â¢ T is the time separator. Shall be a capital T .
```
â¢ <hh> is the two-digit hour (0 to 23).
```
```
â¢ <mm> is the two-digit minute (0 to 59).
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 81
```
â¢ <ss> is the two-digit second (0 to 59).
```
â¢ <SSS> is optional and is the decimal fraction of a second. Shall be one or more digits where the number of digits
implies the precision.
â¢ Z is the zero offset indicator. Shall be a capital Z .
```
â¢ <HH> is the two-digit hour offset (0 to 23).
```
```
â¢ <MM> is the two-digit minute offset (0 to 59).
```
For example, 2015-03-13T04:14:33+06:00 represents March 13, 2015 at 4:14:33 with a +06:00 time offset.
When the time of day is unknown or serves no purpose, the service shall report 00:00:00Z for the time of day value.
9.5.6 Duration values
Duration values are strings according to the ISO 8601 duration format, with the exception of not expressing a
representation for years, months, weeks, or negative values. Duration values shall use the format:
P[<d>D][T[<h>H][<m>M][<s>[.<f>]S]]
where
â¢ <d> is the number of days.
â¢ <h> is the number of hours.
â¢ <m> is the number of minutes.
â¢ <s> is the number of seconds.
â¢ <f> is the fractional seconds.
Each field is optional and can contain more than one digit.
For example, Table 17 describes the following durations:
Table 17 â Durations
Value Duration
P90D Ninety days.
P3D Three days.
PT6H Six hours.
PT10S Ten seconds.
PT0.001S 0.001 seconds.
PT1H30M One hour and 30 minutes.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
82 Published Version 1.23.0
```
DEPRECATED: Duration values shall use the format: P[<y>Y][<m>M][<w>W][<d>D][T[<h>H][<m>M][<s>[.<f>]S]] .
```
This definition allows for specifying years, months, and weeks. ISO 8601 does not specify an exact value for the
duration of a year or of a month, which introduces interoperability challenges.
9.5.7 Reference properties
Reference properties provide a reference to another resource in the data model. Reference properties are JSON
objects that contain an @odata.id property. The @odata.id property value is the URI of the referenced resource.
9.5.8 Non-resource reference properties
Non-resource reference properties provide a URI to services or documents that are not Redfish-defined resources.
These properties shall include the Uri or URI term in their property name and shall be of type string. For example,
AssemblyBinaryDataUri in the Assembly schema. The access protocol, request headers, response headers, and
data format of the referenced URI may be defined in schema for that property. Non-resource reference properties
that refer to local HTTP/S targets shall follow the Redfish protocol, including use of Redfish sessions and access
control, unless otherwise specified by the property definition in schema.
9.5.9 Array properties
Array properties contain a set of values or objects, and appear as JSON arrays within a response body. Array
elements shall all contain values of the same data type.
Table 18 describes the array types, regardless of the data type of the elements:
Table 18 â Array types
Array type Description
Fixed length Contains a static number of elements. The property definition sets or the implementation chooses the size of the array.
Variable length Contains a variable number of elements. The array size is not specified and the size varies among instances. The arraysize may change. This array style is the most common style.
Rigid
The array index is meaningful. When elements are added to or removed from the array, the elements do not change
their position, or index, in the array. An element that is removed from a rigid array shall be replaced by a null element
and all other elements shall remain at their current index.
Empty elements in a rigid array property shall be represented by null elements. Any array property that uses this
style shall indicate the rigid style in the long description of its schema definition.
Services may pad an array property with null elements at the end of the sequence to indicate the array size to
clients. This practice is useful for small fixed-length arrays, and for variable or rigid arrays with a restrictive maximum
size. Services should not pad array properties if the maximum array size is not restrictive. For example, an array
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 83
property typically populated with two elements, that a service limits to a maximum of 16 elements, should not pad the
array with 14 null elements.
9.5.10 Structured properties
Structured properties are JSON objects within a response body.
Some structured properties inherit from the Resource.v1_0_0.ReferenceableMember definition. Structured properties
that follow this definition shall contain the MemberId and resource identifier properties.
Because the definition of structured properties can evolve over time, clients need to be aware of the inheritance
model that the different structured property definitions use.
For example, the Location property definition in the Resource schema has gone through several iterations since the
Resource.v1_1_0 type was introduced, and each iteration inherits from the earlier version so that existing references
in other schemas can leverage the additions.
Structured property references need to be resolved for both local and external references.
A local reference is a resource that has a structured property in its own schema, such as ProcessorSummary in the
ComputerSystem resource. In these cases, the type property for the resource is the starting point for resolving the
structured property definition.
To find the latest applicable version, clients can step the version of the resource backwards.
For example, if a service returns #ComputerSystem.v1_4_0.ComputerSystem as the resource type, a client can step
backwards from ComputerSystem.v1_4_0 , to ComputerSystem.v1_3_0 , to ComputerSystem.v1_2_0 , and so on, until it
finds the ProcessorSummary structured property definition.
An external reference is a resource that has a property that references a definition found in a different schema, such
as the Location property in the Chassis resource.
In these cases, clients can use the latest version of the external schema file as a starting point to resolve the
structured property definition.
For example, if the latest version of the Resource schema is 1.6.0 , a client can go backward from
Resource.v1_6_0 , to Resource.v1_5_0 , to Resource.v1_4_0 , and so on, until it finds the Location structured
property definition.
9.5.11 Message object
9.5.11.1 Overview
A message object provides additional information about an object, property, or error response.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
84 Published Version 1.23.0
Table 19 describes the properties of the message object, which is a JSON object:
Table 19 â Message object properties
Property Type Required Defines
MessageId String Yes
Error or message. Do not confuse this value with the HTTP status
code. Clients can use this code to access a detailed message
from a message registry.
Message String No
Human-readable error message that indicates the semantics
associated with the error. This shall be the complete message,
and not rely on substitution variables.
RelatedProperties An array of JSON pointers No Properties in a JSON payload that the message describes.
MessageArgs An array of strings No
Substitution parameter values for the message. If the
parameterized message defines a MessageId , the service shall
include the MessageArgs in the response.
```
MessageSeverity String (enumeration) No
```
Severity of the error. Services can replace the value of the
MessageSeverity property defined in the message registry with a
value more applicable to the implementation.
Severity String No
Severity of the error. Services can replace the value of the
Severity property defined in the message registry with a value
more applicable to the implementation.
```
DEPRECATED: This property has been deprecated in favor of
```
MessageSeverity .
Resolution String No
Recommended actions to take to resolve the error. Services can
replace the value of the Resolution property defined in the
message registry with a service-defined resolution.
Each instance of a message object shall contain at least a MessageId , together with any applicable MessageArgs , or
a Message property that defines the complete human-readable error message.
A MessageId identifies a specific message that a message registry defines.
9.5.11.2 MessageId format
The MessageId property value shall be in the format:
<MessageRegistryPrefix>.<MajorVersion>.<MinorVersion>.<MessageKey>
where
â¢ <MessageRegistryPrefix> is the name of the message registry. The message registry name shall be Pascal-
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 85
```
cased, except for any prepended unique OEM identifier which may include underscore ( _ ) characters. The
```
message registry name shall be exposed in the RegistryPrefix property in the message registry.
â¢ <MajorVersion> is a non-negative integer that represents the major version of the message registry.
â¢ <MinorVersion> is a non-negative integer that represents the minor version of the message registry.
â¢ <MessageKey> is a human-readable key into the message registry. The message key shall be Pascal-cased and
shall not include spaces, periods, or special characters.
To search the message registry for a message, the client can use the MessageId .
The message registry approach has advantages for internationalization because the message registry can be
translated easily and is lightweight for implementations because large strings need not be included with the
implementation.
The use of GeneralError from the Base Message Registry as a MessageId in ExtendedInfo is discouraged. If no
better message exists or the ExtendedInfo array contains multiple messages, use GeneralError from the Base
Message Registry only in the code property of the error object.
When an implementation uses GeneralError from the Base Message Registry in ExtendedInfo , the implementation
should include a service-defined value for the Resolution property with this error to indicate how to resolve the
problem.
9.6 Properties
9.6.1 Properties overview
Every property included in a Redfish response payload shall be defined in the schema for that resource. The
following attributes apply to all property definitions:
â¢ Property names in the request and response payload shall match the casing of the Name attribute value in the
defining schema.
â¢ Required properties shall always be returned in a response.
â¢ Properties not returned from a GET operation indicate that the property is not supported by the implementation,
or by that particular resource instance. Differences in underlying product support or configuration varies among
resource instances, and therefore the properties returned by each instance vary accordingly.
â¢ If an implementation supports a property, it shall always provide a value for that property. If a value is unknown
at the time of the operation due to an internal error, or inaccessibility of the data, the value of null is an
acceptable value if supported by the schema definition.
â¢ Resource instances should omit properties if the underlying product, service, or current configuration does not
provide the function described by the property. For example, a chassis resource instance might not provide a
serial number, and therefore should omit the SerialNumber property, while other chassis resource instances that
have a serial number provide this property. See the Special resource situations clause for handling special
resource situations.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
86 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ A service may implement a writable property as read-only.
â¢ All property definitions in schema shall specify a well-known data type, with exceptions in the following standard
```
schemas:
```
â¦ AttributeRegistry and Bios : To support arbitrary BIOS settings of different data types.
This clause also contains a set of common properties across all Redfish resources. The property names in this
clause shall not be used for any other purpose.
```
9.6.2 Resource identifier (@odata.id) property
```
Registry resources in a response may include an @odata.id property. All other resources and resource collections in
a response shall include an @odata.id property. The value of the identifier property shall be the resource URI.
```
9.6.3 Resource type (@odata.type) property
```
All resources and resource collections in a response shall include an @odata.type type property. To support generic
OData clients, all structured properties in a response should include an @odata.type type property.
The value of the type property for resources and structured properties shall be in the format:
#<ResourceType>.<Version>.<TermName>
where
â¢ <ResourceType> is the resource type in the Redfish schema that defines the resource.
â¢ <Version> is the resource type version, in the format: v<MajorVersion>_<MinorVersion>_<ErrataVersion> .
â¢ <TermName> is the specific type defined within the resource type definition. For most Redfish resources, the
specific type name is the same as the resource type name.
An example of a resource type value is #ComputerSystem.v1_0_0.ComputerSystem , where ComputerSystem.v1_0_0
denotes the version 1.0.0 of the ComputerSystem resource type, and the specific type is ComputerSystem .
The value of the type property for resource collections shall be in the format:
#<ResourceType>.<ResourceType>
where
â¢ <ResourceType> is the resource type in the Redfish schema that defines the resource collection.
An example of a resource collection type value is #ComputerSystemCollection.ComputerSystemCollection for the
ComputerSystemCollection resource collection.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 87
```
9.6.4 Resource ETag (@odata.etag) property
```
ETags enable clients to conditionally retrieve or update a resource. Resources should include an @odata.etag
property. For a resource, the value shall be the ETag.
```
9.6.5 Resource context (@odata.context) property
```
Responses for resources and resource collections may contain an @odata.context property that describes the
source of the payload.
If the @odata.context property is present, it shall be the context URL that describes the resource, according to
OData Protocol.
The context URL for a resource should be in the format:
/redfish/v1/$metadata#<ResourceType>.<ResourceType>
where
â¢ <ResourceType> is the resource type of the resource or resource collection.
For example, the following context URL specifies that the results show a single ComputerSystem resource:
```
{
```
"@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#ComputerSystem.ComputerSystem",
...
```
}
```
The context URL for a resource may be in one of the other formats that OData Protocol specifies.
9.6.6 Id
The Id property of a resource uniquely identifies the resource within the resource collection that contains it. The
value of Id shall be a string that is unique across a resource collection. Since URIs are constructed from the value
of the Id property, the value shall not contain any RFC1738-defined unsafe characters.
9.6.7 Name
The Name property conveys a human-readable moniker for a resource. The data type of the Name property shall be
string. The value of Name is NOT required to be unique across resource instances within a resource collection.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
88 Published Version 1.23.0
9.6.8 Description
The Description property conveys a human-readable description of the resource. The data type of the Description
property shall be string.
9.6.9 MemberId
The MemberId property uniquely identifies an element within an array, where a reference property can reference the
element. The value of MemberId shall be a string that is unique across the array.
```
9.6.10 Count (Members@odata.count) property
```
The count property defines the total number of resource, or members, that are available in a resource collection. The
count property shall be named Members@odata.count and its value shall be the total number of members available in
the resource collection. The $top or $skip query parameters shall not affect this count. If the number of members
available in the resource collection is reduced due to filtering, such as in response to the $filter query parameter,
the count should be the total number of members available in the resource collection after the filter is applied.
9.6.11 Members
The Members property of a resource collection identifies the members of the collection. The Members property is
required and shall be returned in the response for any resource collection. The Members property shall be an array of
JSON objects named Members . The Members property shall not be null . Empty collections shall be an empty JSON
array.
```
9.6.12 Next link (Members@odata.nextLink) property
```
```
The next link ( Members@odata.nextLink ) property value shall be an opaque URL to a resource, with the same
```
@odata.type , which contains the next set of partial members from the original operation. The next link property shall
only be present if the number of members in the resource collection is greater than the number of members returned,
and if the payload does not represent the end of the requested resource collection.
The next link property may contain the $skiptoken query parameter. The $skiptoken query parameter shall contain
an opaque value that allows a client to reference the next page of the collection. Clients shall not interpret or
construct $skiptoken values.
The next link property value should contain control information provided by the client in query parameters that affect
the size of the collection and properties returned in the response, such as the $filter and $expand query
parameters. For example, if a client performs a request to /redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Sensors?$filter=Status/Health eq
'OK'&$expand=. , some appropriate values include:
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 89
â¢ /redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Sensors?$filter=Status/Health eq 'OK'&$expand=.&$skip=50
â¢ /redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Sensors?$filter=Status/Health eq 'OK'&$expand=.&$skiptoken=1
â¢ /redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Sensors?$skiptoken=ffb559f3-7ee9-42d6-ac8b-888c0ad24db3
â¦ In this case, the skip token internally maintains the client's filter and expand request.
The Members@odata.count property value is the total number of resources available if the client enumerates all pages
of the resource collection.
9.6.13 Links
The Links property represents the hyperlinks associated with the resource, as defined by that resource's schema
definition. All associated reference properties defined for a resource shall be nested under the links property. All
```
directly (subordinate) referenced properties defined for a resource shall be in the root of the resource. There are
```
some exceptions to these rules, such as where ease of expansion or deep operations is beneficial to the user.
The links property shall be named Links and contain a property for each related resource.
To navigate vendor-specific hyperlinks, the Links property shall also include an Oem property.
9.6.13.1 Reference to a related resource
A reference to a single resource is a JSON object that contains a single resource identifier property. The name of this
reference is the name of the relationship. The value of this reference is the URI of the referenced resource.
```
{
```
```
"Links": {
```
```
"ManagedBy": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/Encl1"
```
}
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
9.6.13.2 References to multiple related resources
A reference to a set of zero or more related resources is an array of JSON objects. The name of this reference is the
name of the relationship. Each element of the array is a JSON object that contains a resource identifier property with
the value of the URI of the referenced resource.
```
{
```
```
"Links": {
```
```
"Contains": [{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/1"
Redfish Specification DSP0266
90 Published Version 1.23.0
```
}, {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/Encl1"
```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
9.6.14 Actions property
The Actions property contains the actions supported by a resource.
9.6.14.1 Action representation
Each supported action is represented as a property nested under Actions . The unique name that identifies the
action is used to construct the property name.
This property name shall be in the format:
#<ResourceType>.<ActionName>
where
â¢ <ResourceType> is the resource where the action is defined.
â¢ <ActionName> is the name of the action.
The client may use this fragment to identify the action definition in the referenced Redfish schema document.
The property for the action is a JSON object and contains the following properties:
â¢ The target property shall be present and defines the relative or absolute URL to invoke the action.
â¢ The title property may be present and defines the action's name.
The OData JSON Format Specification defines the target and title properties.
To specify the list of supported values for a parameter, the service may include the @Redfish.AllowableValues
annotation.
For example, the following property defines the Reset action for a ComputerSystem :
```
{
```
```
"#ComputerSystem.Reset": {
```
"target": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset",
"title": "Computer System Reset",
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 91
"ResetType@Redfish.AllowableValues": ["On", "ForceOff", "GracefulRestart",
"GracefulShutdown", "ForceRestart", "Nmi", "ForceOn",
"PushPowerButton"]
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
Given this, the client could invoke a POST request to /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset with the
following body:
POST /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset HTTP/1.1
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed length>
OData-Version: 4.0
```
{
```
"ResetType": "On"
```
}
```
The resource may provide a separate @Redfish.ActionInfo resource to describe the parameters and values that a
particular instance or implementation supports. Use the @Redfish.ActionInfo annotation to specify the ActionInfo
resource, which contains a URI to the @Redfish.ActionInfo resource for the action. For details, see the Action info
annotation clause.
9.6.14.2 Action responses
Response payloads for actions may contain a JSON body that is described by the schema definition for the action.
See the Schema definition languages clause for the representation of these definitions. Actions that do not define a
response body may provide an error response in the response payload.
Clients can discover the schema definition of the action response based on the property name of the action found in
GET responses for resources containing the action. For example, if an action is named
#ContosoComputerSystem.Reset , a client can find the action response definition, if there is one available, by locating
the Reset action definition found in the ContosoComputerSystem schema.
9.6.15 Oem
The Oem property is used for extending standard resources with OEM extensions.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
92 Published Version 1.23.0
9.6.16 Status
The Status property represents the status of a resource. The Status property shall follow the definition for Status
in the Resource schema.
By having a common representation of status, clients can depend on consistent semantics. The Status property is
capable of indicating the current state, health of the resource, and the health of subordinate resources.
9.7 Naming conventions
The Redfish interface is intended to be easily readable and intuitive. Thus, consistency helps the consumer
understand the use of a newly discovered property. While consistency is no substitute for the normative information
in the Redfish Specification and Redfish schema, the following naming rules help with readability and client usage. In
general, names in Redfish are designed and intended to be human-readable and convey the meaning of the name,
in context, without the need to consult schema definitions or other documentation.
9.7.1 Naming rules
Standard Redfish schema and registries defined and published by DMTF as well as those created by others and
republished by DMTF shall follow a set of naming conventions. These conventions are intended to ensure consistent
naming and eliminate naming collisions. For schema files, the resource type is used to construct the type property
and the schema file name.
Standard Redfish properties follow similar naming conventions, and should use a common definition when defined in
multiple schemas across the Redfish data model. This consistency enables code re-use across resources and
increases interoperability. New resource definitions should leverage existing property definitions whenever possible.
The general Redfish naming rules for resource types, registries, properties, and action parameters are as follows:
â¢ Names shall be Pascal-cased. The first letter of each word in a name shall be uppercase and spaces between
words shall be removed. For example, ComputerSystem , PowerState , and SerialNumber .
â¢ Names shall differ from other defined names by more than case sensitivity. For example, SnmpV1 cannot be
used as a name if SNMPv1 is also defined.
â¢ Names of array properties or reference properties for resource collections should use a plural form of the name.
All other names should use the singular form of the name.
â¢ Reference properties for resource collections should omit the term "collection" in the name.
```
â¢ Names shall start with an alphabetic character ( a to z and A to Z ) and consist only of alphanumeric
```
```
characters ( a to z , A to Z , and 0 to 9 ).
```
â¢ Both characters should be capitalized for two-character acronyms. For example, IPAddress or RemoteIP .
â¢ Names constructed from a single acronym or mixed-case name, such as LDAP , PCIe , or SNMP , should use the
typical capitalization for that name.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 93
â¢ Names incorporating acronyms with three or more characters should follow the capitalization used in related
names for consistency. For example, EnableSNMPv1 and EnableSNMPv2 follow the pattern used for SNMP .
â¢ Pascal-casing may be used for acronyms longer than two characters to improve readability, especially when two
or more acronyms appear together in a name, which should be avoided.
â¢ The names Settings and SD are reserved for use for settings resources and shall not be used for schema
names.
â¢ Names that represent a string-typed HTTP URI, and is not a reference property, should end in URI . For
example, TargetComponentURI .
â¢ The name ReturnType is reserved for RDE usage and shall not be used for action parameter names.
Exceptions are allowed for the following cases:
â¢ Well-known technology abbreviations, acronyms, or product names should follow their defined capitalization.
Examples include iSCSI , iSCSITarget , and iLO .
â¢ OEM appears as Oem in schema and property names either alone or as a portion of a name, but should be OEM
when used alone as an enumeration value.
â¢ Underscore characters are allowed in the construction of OEM-specified object property names when required,
and in OEM-defined resource types or OEM-defined registry names.
Enumeration values follow the above rules and exceptions. Additionally, enumeration values:
â¢ Should start with a letter and be followed by letters or numbers to conform to schema description language
requirements. Underscore characters may be used to replace other special characters, or to significantly
improve readability, but this usage is discouraged.
â¢ Should prioritize readability as they may appear unmodified on user interfaces, whereas property or schema
names should follow conventions and strive for consistency.
For properties that have units or other special meaning, append a unit identifier to the name. Examples include:
```
â¢ Bandwidth (Mbps). For example, PortSpeedMbps .
```
```
â¢ CPU speed (MHz). For example, ProcessorSpeedMHz .
```
```
â¢ Memory size (MB). For example, MemoryMB .
```
```
â¢ Counts of items (Count). For example, ProcessorCount or FanCount .
```
```
â¢ The state of a resource (State). For example, PowerState .
```
â¢ State values where work is in process. For example, Applying or ClearingLogic .
9.7.2 URI naming rules
The following rules apply to Redfish schema-defined URIs:
â¢ URI segments should generally follow the naming rules, and for each segment, follow the name of the property
that provides the hyperlink.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
94 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ URI segments for resource collections should use the plural form of the resource collection schema name, with
the Collection term omitted. For example, Processors for a ProcessorCollection .
â¢ URI segments for resource collections shall not be named Members , as this value will conflict with POST
```
operations on the required Members property. See the POST (create) clause for more information.
```
â¢ If a hyperlink to a subordinate resource is not found at the root of the resource, the URI segments should contain
the property path. For example, for the Certificates hyperlink found in ManagerNetworkProtocol within the
HTTPS object, HTTPS should be one of the URI segments resulting in the URI pattern /redfish/v1/
```
Managers/{ManagerId}/NetworkProtocol/HTTPS/Certificates .
```
Starting with Redfish Specification v1.18.0, in cases where the URI segment does not follow one or more of the
previous rules, the schema definition for the reference property for the URI shall specify the URI segment annotation
to define the URI segment to append.
9.8 Extending standard resources
9.8.1 Extending standard resources overview
In the context of this clause, the OEM term refers to any company, manufacturer, or organization that provides or
defines an extension to DMTF-published schema and functionality for Redfish. All Redfish-specified resources
include an empty structured Oem property. The value of this predefined placeholder can encapsulate one or more
OEM-specified object properties, which can contain OEM-specific property definitions.
9.8.2 OEM property format and content
Each property contained within the Oem property shall be an OEM-specified JSON object. The name of each object
property shall uniquely identify the OEM or organization that defines the properties contained by that object. The
OEM-specified object naming clause describes this naming convention.
The OEM-specified object shall include a type property if the object:
â¢ Is not contained in an array of objects.
â¢ Is contained in the first object within an array of objects.
â¢ Is contained in subsequent objects within an array of objects, whose type is different from the first array member.
To avoid naming collisions with other OEM definitions, the type property should start with the defining organization's
```
unique OEM identifier, including possible subdivisioning. Separator underscores ( _ ) may be excluded from the type
```
property and schema file name for improved readability. The Schema definition languages clause contains file name
construction rules, such as handling version information. See OEM property examples for examples.
The Oem property can simultaneously hold multiple OEM-specified objects, including objects for more than one
company or organization.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 95
The definition of any other properties that are contained within the OEM-specified object, along with the functional
specifications, validation, or other requirements for that content is OEM-specific and outside the scope of this
specification. While there are no Redfish-specified limits on the size or complexity of the elements within an OEM-
specified object, it is intended it is typically used for only a small number of simple properties that augment the
Redfish resource. If a large number of objects or a large quantity of data compared to the size of the Redfish
resource is to be supported, the OEM should consider creating a subordinate resource for their extensions.
9.8.3 OEM-specified object naming
The OEM-specified object properties within the Oem property are named by using a unique OEM identifier. There are
```
two specified forms for the identifier. The identifier shall be either an ICANN-recognized domain name (including the
```
```
top-level domain suffix), with all dot ( . ) separators replaced with underscores ( _ ), or an IANA-assigned Enterprise
```
Number prefixed with "EID_."
```
DEPRECATED: The identifier shall be either an ICANN-recognized domain name including the top-level
```
domain suffix, or an IANA-assigned Enterprise Number prefixed with EID: .
Organizations that use .com domain names may omit the .com suffix. For example, Contoso.com would use
Contoso instead of Contoso_com , but Contoso.org would use Contoso_org . The domain name portion of an OEM
identifier shall be considered to be case-insensitive. That is, the text Contoso_biz , contoso_BIZ , conTOso_biZ , and
so on all identify the same OEM.
```
The OEM identifier portion of the object name may be followed by an underscore ( _ ) and any additional string to
```
enable further subdivisions of OEM-specified objects as desired. For example, Contoso_xxxx or EID_412_xxxx . The
form and meaning of any text that follows the trailing underscore is completely OEM-specific. OEM-specified
extension suffixes may be case-sensitive, depending on the OEM. Generic client software should treat such
extensions, if present, as opaque and not try to parse nor interpret the content.
There are organizations with which DMTF has a working relationship and have registered their OEM namespace
directly in the specification to allow extensions of the ICANN domain name requirements above. The following
organization OEM namespaces shall be considered reserved:
â¢ OpenBMC
â¢ OpenCompute
This suffix could be used in many ways, depending on OEM need. For example, the Contoso company may have a
Research sub-organization, in which case the OEM-specified property name might be extended to
Contoso_Research. Alternatively, it can identify a unique resource type for a functional area, geography, subsidiary,
and so on.
The OEM identifier portion of the name typically identifies the company or organization that created and maintains
the schema for the property. However, this practice is not a requirement. The identifier is only required to uniquely
identify the party that is the top-level manager of a resource type to prevent collisions between OEM property
definitions from different vendors or organizations. Consequently, the organization for the top of the resource type
Redfish Specification DSP0266
96 Published Version 1.23.0
may be different from the organization that provides the definition of the OEM-specified property. For example,
Contoso may allow one of their customers, such as CustomerA , to extend a Contoso product with certain CustomerA
proprietary properties. In this case, although Contoso allocated the name Contoso_CustomerA , it could be CustomerA
that defines the content and functionality within that resource type. In all cases, OEM identifiers should not be used
except with permission or as specified by the identified company or organization.
9.8.4 OEM resource types
Companies, OEMs, and other organizations can define additional resources and link to them from an Oem property
in a standard Redfish resource, preferably from the Oem property within the Links property. To avoid naming
collisions with current or future standard Redfish resource types or schema files, the defining organization's unique
OEM identifier, including possible subdivisioning, should be prepended to the OEM resource type name with an
```
optional underscore ( _ ) as separator. This unique OEM identifier should follow the same naming as defined in the
```
OEM-specified object naming clause. The name of the OEM resource type, including the unique OEM identifier,
should also be prepended to the file name of OEM schema file that specifies the OEM resource type. Separator
```
underscores ( _ ) may be excluded from the OEM resource type name and schema file name for improved
```
readability. The Schema definition languages clause contains other file name construction rules, such as handling
version information.
For example, OEM resource type ContosoDrive or Contoso_CustomerA_Drive would not conflict with the standard
Redfish Drive resource type, or conflict with another OEM's drive-related definition.
9.8.5 OEM registries
Companies, OEMs, and other organizations can define additional registries and utilize them in message objects,
privileges or for BIOS attributes. To avoid naming collisions with current or future standard Redfish message
registries, the defining organization's unique OEM identifier, including possible subdivisioning, should be prepended
```
to the registry name with an optional underscore ( _ ) as separator. This unique OEM identifier should follow the
```
```
same naming as defined in the OEM-specified object naming clause. Separator underscores ( _ ) may be excluded
```
from the OEM registry name for improved readability. The OEM registry name, including the unique OEM identifier,
should also be used to construct the registry file name as defined in the Registry file naming clause.
For example, OEM registry name ContosoDriveEvent or Contoso_CustomerB_DriveEvent would not conflict with a
possible future standard Redfish DriveEvent message registry name, or conflict with another OEM's drive-related
registry name.
9.8.6 OEM URIs
To avoid URI collisions with other OEM resources and future Redfish standard resources, the URIs for OEM
resources within the Redfish resource tree shall be in the form:
<BaseUri>/Oem/<OemIdentifier>/<ResourcePath>
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 97
where
â¢ <BaseUri> is the URI segment of the standard Redfish resource starting with /redfish/ where the Oem
property is used. For example, /redfish/v1/Systems/3AZ38944T523 .
â¢ <OemIdentifier> is the unique identifier of the OEM, including possible subdivisioning, that follows the same
```
naming as defined in the OEM-specified object naming clause. Separator underscores ( _ ) may be excluded for
```
improved readability.
â¢ <ResourcePath> is the path to the OEM-defined resource. This path might contain multiple segments for cases
where OEM-defined resources are subordinate to an OEM-defined resource. Each segment in the path contains
the name of an OEM-defined resource.
For example, if Contoso defined a new ContosoAccountServiceMetrics OEM resource type to be linked through the
Oem property at the /redfish/v1/AccountService URI, the OEM resource has the /redfish/v1/AccountService/Oem/
Contoso/AccountServiceMetrics URI. If Contoso uses a subdivision of their OEM identifier such as
Contoso_CustomerA the OEM resource has the URI /redfish/v1/AccountService/Oem/Contoso_CustomerA/
AccountServiceMetrics or /redfish/v1/AccountService/Oem/ContosoCustomerA/AccountServiceMetrics .
9.8.7 OEM property examples
The following fragment shows examples of naming and the Oem property as it might appear when accessing a
resource. The example shows that the OEM identifiers can be of different forms, that OEM-specified content can be
simple or complex, and that the format and usage of extensions of the OEM identifier is OEM-specific.
```
{
```
```
"Oem": {
```
```
"Contoso": {
```
"@odata.type": "#ContosoAnvil.v1_2_1.AnvilTypes1",

Redfish Specification DSP0266
98 Published Version 1.23.0
"Target": "Rabbit"
```
}
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
9.8.8 OEM actions
OEM-specific actions appear in the JSON payload as properties of the Oem object, nested under an Actions
property.
The name of the property that represents the action, which shall follow the form:
#<OEMSchemaName>.<Action>
where
â¢ <OEMSchemaName> is the name of the schema containing the OEM extension. To avoid naming collisions with
other OEM definitions, the schema name should start with the defining organization's unique OEM identifier,
```
including possible subdivisioning. Separator underscores ( _ ) may be excluded for improved readability.
```
â¢ <Action> is the action name.
```
{
```
```
"Actions": {
```
```
"Oem": {
```
```
"#Contoso_ABC_ComputerSystem.Ping": {
```
"target": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/Oem/Contoso_ABC_ComputerSystem.Ping",
"@Redfish.ActionInfo": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Oem/Contoso_ABC/PingActionInfo"
```
},
```
```
"#ContosoCustomerAComputerSystem.CustomPing": {
```
"target": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/Oem/ContosoCustomerAComputerSystem.CustomPing",
"@Redfish.ActionInfo": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Oem/ContosoCustomerA/CustomPingActionInfo"
```
}
```
```
}
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
The URI of the OEM action in the target property shall be in the form:
<ResourceUri>/Actions/Oem/<OEMSchemaName>.<Action>
where
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 99
â¢ <ResourceUri> is the URI of the resource that supports invoking the action. For example, /redfish/v1/Systems/
1/ .
â¢ Actions is the name of the property containing the actions for a resource.
â¢ Oem is the name of the OEM property within the Actions property.
â¢ <OEMSchemaName>.<Action> is the name of the schema containing the OEM extension followed by the action
name. For example, Contoso_ABC_ComputerSystem.Ping .
The URI to the ActionInfo resource should be in the form:
<ResourceUri>/Oem/<OemIdentifier>/<Action>ActionInfo
where
â¢ <ResourceUri> is the URI of the resource that supports invoking the action. For example, /redfish/v1/Systems/
1/ .
â¢ <OemIdentifier> is the unique identifier of the OEM, including possible subdivisioning, that follows the same
```
naming as defined in the OEM-specified object naming clause. Separator underscores ( _ ) may be excluded for
```
improved readability.
â¢ <Action> is the action name.
9.9 Payload annotations
9.9.1 Payload annotations overview
Resources, objects within a resource, and properties may include additional annotations as properties with the name,
in the format:
[<PropertyName>]@<Namespace>.<TermName>
where
â¢ <PropertyName> is the name of the property to annotate. If absent, the annotation applies to the entire JSON
object, which may be an entire resource.
â¢ <Namespace> is the namespace that defines the annotation term.
â¢ <TermName> is the annotation term to apply to the resource or property of the resource.
Services shall limit the annotation usage to the odata , Redfish , and Message namespaces. The OData JSON
Format Specification defines the odata namespace. The Redfish namespace is an alias for the
RedfishExtensions.v1_0_0 namespace.
The client can get the definition of the annotation from the OData metadata document, the HTTP Link header, or
Redfish Specification DSP0266
100 Published Version 1.23.0
may ignore the annotation entirely, but should not fail reading the resource due to unrecognized annotations,
including new annotations that the Redfish namespace defines.
9.9.2 Allowable values for strings
Services may use the @Redfish.AllowableValues annotation to specify the list of allowable values for a string
property in modification requests or action parameter. The values of the annotation should only include those values
that are both supported by the service and currently available as valid values for the particular instance of the
property or action parameter. The annotation shall contain a JSON array of strings that define the allowable values
for the property or action parameter.
The following example shows that the FavoriteFruit property supports four values.
```
{
```
"FavoriteFruit": "Kiwi",
"FavoriteFruit@Redfish.AllowableValues": [ "Orange", "Pineapple", "Kiwi", "Starfruit" ]
```
}
```
9.9.3 Allowable patterns for string values
Services may use the @Redfish.AllowablePattern annotation to specify a pattern that describes the valid values for a
string property in modification requests or action parameter. The annotation shall contain a regular expression that
describes the supported pattern for the property or action parameter. If a pattern is specified in the schema definition
for this property, this annotation may further restrict the allowable values, but shall not allow values which would
violate the schema-defined pattern. Services shall not use the @Redfish.AllowablePattern for enumerations.
The following example shows the AssetTag property allows alphanumeric characters, colons, and dashes, and
allows a string length up to 31 characters.
```
{
```
"AssetTag": "22HOU-34566",
```
"AssetTag@Redfish.AllowablePattern": "^[\\w:-]{0,31}$"
```
```
}
```
9.9.4 Allowable values for numbers and durations
Services may use the @Redfish.AllowableNumbers annotation to specify one or more ranges of allowable values and
an optional incremental step value between valid values for a numeric property in modification requests or action
parameter or duration property or action parameter. The annotation shall contain an array of strings, each specifying
a range of values and an optional step value. Each element in the array shall contain a number or a duration in the
```
format:
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 101
<min>:<max>:<step>
where
â¢ <min> is the supported value or the lowest value in an inclusive range.
â¢ <max> is the highest value in an inclusive range.
â¢ <step> is the incremental step value added to the <min> value in series within the inclusive range.
If the value does not contain : characters, the value specifies a single supported value.
If the value specifies a range and <min> is omitted, the minimum supported value shall be assumed to be a value of
zero.
If the value specifies a range and :<step> is omitted, no step is defined for the supported range.
The following example shows the usage of the @Redfish.AllowableNumbers annotation for different properties.
PacketSizeBytes supports a range of 1024 to 65536 in increments of 256. TemperatureThresholdCelsius supports a
range of 0 to 50 with no step restrictions. ClockSpeedMHz supports 800, 1150, or 1600 to 5000 in increments of 100.
TimeoutDuration supports a duration between 5 minutes and 24 hours, in 5 minute increments.
```
{
```
"PacketSizeBytes": 2048,

9.9.5 Extended information
The following clauses describe the methods of providing extended information:
â¢ Extended object information
â¢ Extended property information
9.9.5.1 Extended object information
To specify object-level status information, services may annotate a JSON object with the @Message.ExtendedInfo
annotation.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
102 Published Version 1.23.0
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Managers/1/SerialInterfaces/1",

],
"Severity": "Warning",
"MessageSeverity": "Warning",
"Resolution": "Remove the duplicate property from the request body and resubmit the request if the
operation failed."
```
}]
```
```
}
```
The property contains an array of message objects.
9.9.5.2 Extended property information
Services may use @Message.ExtendedInfo , prepended with the name of the property to annotate an individual
property in a JSON object with extended information:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Managers/1/SerialInterfaces/1",
"@odata.type": "#SerialInterface.v1_0_0.SerialInterface",

```
}]
```
```
}
```
9.9.5.3 Extended information implementation notes
Services should provide the extended object or property payload annotations in responses to PATCH or PUT
requests for the following conditions:
â¢ If a client attempts to modify a property that is read-only, include the PropertyNotWritable message from the
Base Message Registry.
â¢ If an internal error prevents an update to a property, include the PropertyNotUpdated message from the Base
Message Registry.
â¢ If properties are not updated and the service does not have sufficient space to report all messages, include the
MaximumErrorsExceeded message from the Base Message Registry.
Services should provide the extended object or property payload annotations in responses to PATCH or PUT
requests for other non-successful conditions not listed previously.
9.9.6 Action info annotation
The @Redfish.ActionInfo term within the action representation conveys the parameter requirements and allowable
values on parameters for actions. This term contains a URI to the ActionInfo resource.
The URI to the ActionInfo resource should be in the form:
<ResourceUri>/<Action>ActionInfo
where
Redfish Specification DSP0266
104 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ <ResourceUri> is the URI of the resource that supports invoking the action. For example, /redfish/v1/Systems/
1/ .
â¢ <Action> is the action name.
Example #ComputerSystem.Reset action with the @Redfish.ActionInfo annotation and resource:
```
{
```
```
"Actions": {
```
```
"#ComputerSystem.Reset": {
```
"target": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset",
"@Redfish.ActionInfo": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/ResetActionInfo"
```
}
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
The ResetActionInfo resource contains a more detailed description of the parameters and the supported values.
This resource follows the ActionInfo schema definition.
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/ResetActionInfo",
"@odata.type": "#ActionInfo.v1_0_0.ActionInfo",
"Id": "ResetActionInfo",
"Name": "Reset Action Info",
```
"Parameters": [{
```
"Name": "ResetType",
"Required": true,
"DataType": "String",
"AllowableValues": ["On", "ForceOff", "ForceRestart", "Nmi",
"ForceOn", "PushPowerButton"]
```
}]
```
```
}
```
9.9.7 Settings and settings apply time annotations
See the Settings resource clause.
9.9.8 Operation apply time and operation apply time support annotations
See the Operation apply time clause.
9.9.9 Maintenance window annotation
The settings apply time and operation apply time annotations enable an operation to be performed during a
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 105
maintenance window. The @Redfish.MaintenanceWindow term at the root of a resource configures the start time and
duration of a maintenance window for a resource.
The following example body for the /redfish/v1/Systems/1 resource configures the maintenance window to start at
2017-05-03T23:12:37-05:00 and last for 600 seconds.
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1",
"@odata.type": "#ComputerSystem.v1_5_0.ComputerSystem",
```
"@Redfish.MaintenanceWindow": {
```
"@odata.type": "#Settings.v1_3_3.MaintenanceWindow",
"MaintenanceWindowStartTime": "2017-05-03T23:12:37-05:00",
"MaintenanceWindowDurationInSeconds": 600
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
9.9.10 Collection capabilities annotation
Resource collections may contain a collection capabilities annotation. The @Redfish.CollectionCapabilities term at
the root of a resource collection shows what properties a client is allowed to use in a POST request for creating a
resource.
The following ComputerSystemCollection example body contains the collection capabilities annotation. The UseCase
property contains the ComputerSystemComposition value, and the CapabilitiesObject property contains the
/redfish/v1/Systems/Capabilities value. The resource at /redfish/v1/Systems/Capabilities describes the POST
request format for creating a ComputerSystem resource for compositions.
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems",
"@odata.type": "#ComputerSystemCollection.ComputerSystemCollection",
"Name": "Computer System Collection",
"Members@odata.count": 0,
"Members": [],
```
"@Redfish.CollectionCapabilities": {
```
"@odata.type": "#CollectionCapabilities.v1_1_0.CollectionCapabilities",
```
"Capabilities": [{
```
```
"CapabilitiesObject": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/Capabilities"
```
},
```
"UseCase": "ComputerSystemComposition",
```
"Links": {
```
```
"TargetCollection": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems"
```
}
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266
106 Published Version 1.23.0
```
}
```
```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
The CapabilitiesObject resource follows the same schema for the resource that the resource collection contains. It
contains annotations to show which properties the client can use in the POST request body. Services may omit
properties marked as required for the resource referenced by the CapabilitiesObject property, but may provide
annotations for the property to express POST request body requirements. Table 20 describes the
CapabilitiesObject resource annotations. These annotations describe which properties are required, optional, or if
other rules are associated with the properties.
Table 20 â CapabilitiesObject resource annotations
Annotation Description
<PropertyName>@Redfish.RequiredOnCreate Required in the POST request body.
<PropertyName>@Redfish.OptionalOnCreate Not required in the POST request body.
<PropertyName>@Redfish.SetOnlyOnCreate Cannot be modified after the resource is created.
<PropertyName>@Redfish.UpdatableAfterCreate Can be modified after the resource is created.
<PropertyName>@Redfish.AllowableValues Can be set to any of the listed values.
@Redfish.RequestedCountRequired
Required in the POST request body for the corresponding object to indicate the
number of requested object instances.
Used for composition requests.
@Redfish.ResourceBlockLimits
Indicates restrictions regarding quantities of ResourceBlock resources of a given
type in the POST request body.
Used for composition requests.
Example CapabilitiesObject resource:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/Capabilities",
"@odata.type": "#ComputerSystem.v1_8_0.ComputerSystem",
"Id": "Capabilities",
"Name": "Capabilities for the system collection",
"Name@Redfish.RequiredOnCreate": true,
"Name@Redfish.SetOnlyOnCreate": true,
"Description@Redfish.OptionalOnCreate": true,
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 107
"Description@Redfish.SetOnlyOnCreate": true,
"HostName@Redfish.OptionalOnCreate": true,
"HostName@Redfish.UpdatableAfterCreate": true,
"Links@Redfish.RequiredOnCreate": true,
```
"Links": {
```
"ResourceBlocks@Redfish.RequiredOnCreate": true,
"ResourceBlocks@Redfish.UpdatableAfterCreate": true
```
},
```
```
"@Redfish.ResourceBlockLimits": {
```
"MinCompute": 1,
"MaxCompute": 1,
"MaxStorage": 8
```
}
```
```
}
```
9.9.11 Requested count and allow over-provisioning annotations
Table 21 describes the @Redfish.RequestedCount and @Redfish.AllowOverprovisioning annotations.
Clients use these annotations in composition requests to define the number of resource to allocate and to indicate
whether the Redfish service can provision more resources than the client requests:
Table 21 â RequestCount and AllowOverprovisioning annotations
Annotation Description
@Redfish.RequestedCount Number of requested resources.
@Redfish.AllowOverprovisioning Boolean. If true , the service may provision more resources than the@Redfish.RequestedCount annotation requests. Default is false .
Example client request for at least four and possibly more Processor resources:
```
{
```
```
"Processors": {
```
```
"Members": [{
```
"@Redfish.RequestedCount": 4,
"@Redfish.AllowOverprovisioning": true
```
}]
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266
108 Published Version 1.23.0
9.9.12 Zone affinity annotation
The zone affinity annotation is used by clients in composition requests to indicate the components for the
composition come from the specified resource zone. The @Redfish.ZoneAffinity term in the request body contains
the value of the Id property of the requested resource zone.
Example client request for components to be allocated from the resource zone with the Id property containing 1 :
```
{
```
"@Redfish.ZoneAffinity": "1",
...
```
}
```
9.9.13 Supported certificates annotation
Resource collections of type CertificateCollection should contain a supported certificates annotation. The
@Redfish.SupportedCertificates term at the root of a resource collection shows the different certificate formats
allowed in the resource collection.
Example CertificateCollection that only supports PEM style certificates:
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Managers/BMC/NetworkProtocol/HTTPS/Certificates",
"@odata.type": "#CertificateCollection.CertificateCollection",
"Name": "Certificate collection",
"Members@odata.count": 1,
```
"Members": [{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Managers/BMC/NetworkProtocol/HTTPS/Certificates/1"
```
}],
```
"@Redfish.SupportedCertificates": ["PEM"]
```
}
```
9.9.14 Deprecated annotation
Services may annotate properties with @Redfish.Deprecated if the schema definition has the property marked as
deprecated.
Example deprecated property:
```
{
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 109
"VendorID": "0xABCD",
"VendorID@Redfish.Deprecated": "This property has been deprecated in favor of ModuleManufacturerID.",
...
```
}
```
9.9.15 Writable properties annotation
Services may annotate resources or objects with @Redfish.WriteableProperties to list the properties in the resource
or object whose value may be changed by a modification request. This annotation shall only list those properties that
are defined as read-write in schema, are implemented as read-write by the service, and can be modified given the
current configuration of the resource. When present at the root of a resource, the properties listed shall include only
writable properties at the root level. Writable properties within objects shall be shown in additional annotation
instances within the object. For arrays of objects, if the annotation appears in only the first element of the array, the
values shall apply to all elements of the array.
```
Note: While "writable" is the preferred spelling of the word, the name of the annotation in payloads contains
```
"writeable".
Example writable properties annotations that show writable properties at the root level and an array of objects within
each element:
```
{
```
"UserName": "John Smith",
"Alias": "Major Goofball",
"FavoriteFruit": "Pineapple",
"@Redfish.WriteableProperties": [ "Alias", "FavoriteFruit" ],
"Pets": [
```
{
```
"PetName": "Waffles",
"PetType": "Donkey",
"Friendly": true,
"@Redfish.WriteableProperties": [ "Friendly" ]
```
},
```
```
{
```
"PetName": "Fluffy",
"PetType": "Snake",
"Friendly": false
```
}
```
]
```
}
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266

9.10 Settings resource
A settings resource represents the future intended state of a resource. Some resources have properties that can be
updated and the updates take place immediately. However, some properties need to be updated at a future point in
time, such as after a system reset. While the active resource represents the current state, the settings resource
represents the future intended state.
For resources that support a future intended state, the response shall contain a property with the @Redfish.Settings
payload annotation. When a settings annotation is used, the following conditions shall apply:
â¢ The settings resource shall be of the same schema definition as the active resource.
â¢ The settings resource should contain a subset of updatable properties from the active resource. Additionally, it
shall contain required properties, which are always mandatory.
â¢ The settings resource shall not contain the @Redfish.Settings annotation.
â¢ The settings resource may contain the @Redfish.SettingsApplyTime annotation.
â¢ The URI for the settings resource shall reflect that it is subordinate to the active resource. The URI should be in
the form <BaseUri>/Settings or <BaseUri>/SD where <BaseUri> is the URI of the active resource.
The settings resource shall contain the properties that are updated at a future point in time. For resources that
support a future intended state, Table 22 describes the behavior of supported properties in the resource and settings
resource that a service should support.
Table 22 â Active resource and settings resource property behavior

Modification requests are rejected.
Writable, updates immediately or at a future
point in time.
Active value returned in the resource
response to a GET request.
Modification requests change the active

Future value returned in the settings resource
response to a GET request if a future value is
pending, otherwise not returned.
Modification requests change the future
value.

not immediately.
Active value returned in the resource
response to a GET request.
Modification requests are rejected.
Future value returned in the settings resource

The @Redfish.Settings annotation includes several properties that help clients monitor when the service has
consumed the active resource and determine the success or failure of applying the values.
â¢ The Messages property is a collection of messages that represent the results of the last time the values of the
settings resource were applied.
â¢ The ETag property contains the ETag of the settings resource that was last applied. Immediate updates made
directly to the active resource are not reflected in it.
â¢ The Time property indicates the time when the settings resource was last applied. Immediate updates made
directly to the active resource are not reflected in it.
The following active resource example body supports a settings resource. A client can use the SettingsObject
property to locate the URI of the settings resource.
```
{
```
```
"@Redfish.Settings": {
```
"@odata.type": "#Settings.v1_3_3.Settings",
```
"SettingsObject": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Bios/SD"

```
"MessageId": "Base.1.8.PropertyNotWritable",
"RelatedProperties": ["/Attributes/ProcTurboMode"]
```
}]
```
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
If a service enables a client to indicate when to apply settings:
â¢ The settings resource shall contain a property with the @Redfish.SettingsApplyTime annotation.
â¦ Only settings resources shall contain the @Redfish.SettingsApplyTime annotation.
â¢ The @Redfish.Settings annotation in the active resource shall contain the SupportedApplyTimes property for
showing the allowable values for ApplyTime within @Redfish.SettingsApplyTime .
â¢ Clients can modify the @Redfish.SettingsApplyTime annotation to indicate when to apply the settings.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
112 Published Version 1.23.0
In the following example request, the client indicates that the settings resource values are applied on reset during the
specified maintenance window:
```
{
```
```
"@Redfish.SettingsApplyTime": {
```
"@odata.type": "#Settings.v1_3_3.PreferredApplyTime",
"ApplyTime": "InMaintenanceWindowOnReset",
"MaintenanceWindowStartTime": "2017-05-03T23:12:37-05:00",
"MaintenanceWindowDurationInSeconds": 600
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
9.11 Special resource situations
9.11.1 Overview
Resources need to exhibit common semantic behavior whenever possible. This can be difficult in some situations
discussed in this clause.
9.11.2 Absent resources
Resources may be absent or their state unknown at the time a client requests information about that resource. For
resources that represent removable or optional components, absence provides useful information to clients because
it indicates a capability, such as an empty PCIe slot, DIMM socket, or drive bay, that would not be apparent if the
resource simply did not exist.
This also applies to resources that represent a limited number of items or unconfigured capabilities within an
implementation, but this usage should be applied sparingly and should not apply to resources limited in quantity due
to arbitrary limits. For example, an implementation that limits SoftwareInventory to a maximum of 20 items should
not populate 18 absent resources when only two items are present.
For resources that provide useful data in an absent state and where the URI is expected to remain constant, such as
when a DIMM is removed from a memory socket, the resource should exist and should return the Absent value for
the State property in the Status object.
In this circumstance, any required properties that have no known value shall contain null . Properties whose
support is based on the configuration choice or the type of component installed, and therefore unknown while in the
absent state, should not be returned. Likewise, subordinate resources for an absent resource should not be
populated until their support can be determined. For example, the Power and Thermal resources under a Chassis
resource should not exist for an absent Chassis.
Client software should be aware that when absent resources are later populated, the updated resource may
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 113
represent a different configuration or physical item, and previous data, including read-only properties, obtained from
that resource may be invalid. For example, the Memory resource shows details about a single DIMM socket and the
installed DIMM. When that DIMM is removed, the Memory resource remains as an absent resource to indicate the
empty DIMM socket. Later, a new DIMM is installed in that socket, and the Memory resource represents data about
this new DIMM, which could have completely different characteristics.
9.11.3 Transiently unavailable resources
Resources may be transiently unavailable due to the underlying configuration of a device. For example, a network
adapter might not support management protocols while in a low power state.
For resources that provide useful data in a transiently unavailable state and where the URI is expected to remain
constant, such as when a network adapter is powered off and is unable to respond to management requests, the
resource should exist and should return the StandbyOffline value for the State property in the Status object.
In this circumstance, any required properties that have no known value shall contain null . Properties whose
support is based on the configuration choice or the type of component installed, and therefore unknown while in the
transiently unavailable state, should not be returned. Likewise, subordinate resources for a transiently unavailable
resource should not be populated until their support can be determined.
9.12 Registries
Registry resources assist the client in interpreting Redfish resources beyond the Redfish schema definitions. To get
more information about a resource, event, message, or other item, use an identifier to search registries. This
information can include other properties, property restrictions, and the like. Registries are themselves resources.
Table 23 describes the types of registries that Redfish supports:
Table 23 â Registries
Registry Description See
Attribute
Determines the semantics of each property within the Attributes object in a BIOS or BIOS settings
resource. Because BIOS information can vary from platform to platform, Redfish cannot define a fixed
schema for these values. Attribute registries should be assigned unique identifiers to allow users to match
a given registry with compatible products.
This registry contains both property descriptions and other information, such as data type, allowable
values, and user menu information.
Message
Constructs a message from a MessageId and other message information to present to an end user. The
messages in these registries appear in both eventing and error responses to operations.
This registry is the most common type of registry.
â¢ Error
responses
â¢ Eventing
Redfish Specification DSP0266
114 Published Version 1.23.0
Registry Description See
Privilege
Maps the resources in a Redfish service to the privileges that can complete specified operations against
those resources.
A client can use this information to:
â¢ Determine which roles should have specific privileges.
â¢ Map accounts to those roles so that the accounts can complete operations on Redfish resources.

9.13 Schema annotations
9.13.1 Schema annotations overview
The schema definitions of the data model use schema annotations to provide additional documentation for
developers. This clause describes the different types of schema annotations that the Redfish data model uses. For
information about how each of the annotations are implemented in their respective schema languages, see the
Schema definition languages clause.
9.13.2 Description annotation
The description annotation can be applied to any type, property, action, or parameter to provide a description of
Redfish schema elements suitable for end users or user interface help text.
All schemas that are published or republished by DMTF's Redfish Forum shall include a description annotation on
the following schema definitions:
â¢ Redfish types
â¢ Properties
â¢ Reference properties
â¢ Enumeration values
â¢ Resources and resource collections
â¢ Structured types
9.13.3 Long description annotation
The long description annotation can be applied to any type, property, action, or parameter to provide a formal,
normative specification of the schema element.
When the long descriptions in the Redfish schema contain normative language, the service shall be required to
conform with the statement.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 115
All schemas that are published or republished by DMTF's Redfish Forum shall include a long description annotation
on the following schema definitions:
â¢ Redfish types
â¢ Properties
â¢ Reference properties
â¢ Resources and resource collections
â¢ Structured types
9.13.4 Resource capabilities annotation
The resource capabilities annotation can be applied to resources and resource collections to express the different
type of HTTP operations a client can invoke on the given resource or resource collection.
â¢ Insert capabilities indicate whether a client can perform a POST request on the resource to create a resource.
â¢ Update capabilities indicate whether a client can perform a PATCH or PUT request on the resource.
â¢ Delete capabilities indicate whether a client can perform a DELETE request on the resource.
â¢ A service may implement a subset of the capabilities that are allowed on the resource or resource collection.
All schemas that are published or republished by DMTF's Redfish Forum for resources and resource collections shall
include resource capabilities annotations.
9.13.5 Resource URI patterns annotation
The resource URI patterns annotation expresses the valid URI patterns for a resource or resource collection.
```
The strings for the URI patterns may use { and } characters to express parameters within a given URI pattern,
```
```
where the value between the { and } characters contains the schema name followed by Id . Items between the
```
```
{ and } characters are treated as identifiers within the URI for given instances of a Redfish resource. Clients
```
interpret this as a string to be replaced to access a given resource. A URI pattern may contain multiple identifier
terms to support multiple levels of nested resource collections. The identifier term in the URI pattern shall match the
Id string property for the corresponding resource, or the MemberId string property for the corresponding object
within a resource. The process for forming the strings that are concatenated to form the URI pattern are in the URI
naming rules clause.
The following string is an example URI pattern that describes a ManagerAccount resource: /redfish/v1/
```
AccountService/Accounts/{ManagerAccountId}
```
```
Using the previous example, {ManagerAccountId} is replaced by the Id property of the corresponding
```
ManagerAccount resource. If the Id property for a ManagerAccount resource is John , the full URI for that resource
is /redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/John .
The URI patterns are constructed based on the formation of the resource tree. When constructing the URI pattern for
Redfish Specification DSP0266
116 Published Version 1.23.0
a subordinate resource, the URI pattern for the current resource is used and appended. For example, the
RoleCollection resource is subordinate to AccountService . Because the URI pattern for AccountService is
/redfish/v1/AccountService , the URI pattern for the RoleCollection resource is /redfish/v1/AccountService/
Roles .
In some cases, the subordinate resource is found inside of a structured property of a resource. In these cases, the
name of the structured property appears in the URI pattern for the subordinate resource. For example, the
CertificateCollection resource is subordinate to the ManagerNetworkProtocol resource from the HTTPS property.
```
Because the URI pattern for ManagerNetworkProtocol is /redfish/v1/Managers/{ManagerId}/NetworkProtocol , the
```
```
URI pattern for the CertificateCollection resource is /redfish/v1/Managers/{ManagerId}/NetworkProtocol/HTTPS/
```
Certificates .
All schemas that are published or republished by DMTF's Redfish Forum for resources and resource collections shall
be annotated with the resource URI patterns annotation.
All Redfish resources and Redfish resource collections implemented by a service shall match the URI pattern
described by the resource URI patterns annotation for their given definition.
9.13.6 Additional properties annotation
The additional properties annotation specifies whether a type can contain additional properties outside of those
defined in the schema. Types that do not support additional properties shall not contain properties beyond those
described in the schema.
9.13.7 Permissions annotation
The permissions annotation specifies whether a client can modify the value of a property, or if the property is read-
only.
A service can implement a modifiable property as read-only.
The value of a write-only property, such as Password , cannot be read, and shall be null in responses.
All schemas that are published or republished by DMTF's Redfish Forum shall include a permissions annotation for
all properties that are not structured properties.
9.13.8 Required annotation
The required annotation specifies whether a service needs to support a property. Required properties shall be
annotated with the required annotation. All other properties are optional.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 117
9.13.9 Required on create annotation
The required on create annotation specifies that a property is required to be provided by the client on creation of the
resource. Properties not annotated with the required on create annotation are not required to be provided by the
client on a create operation.
9.13.10 Units of measure annotation
In addition to following the naming rules, properties representing units of measure shall be annotated with the units of
measure annotation to specify the units of measurement for the property.
```
The value of the annotation shall be a string that contains the case-sensitive "(c/s)" symbol of the unit of measure as
```
```
listed in the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM), unless the symbolic representation does not reflect common
```
```
usage. If the unit in common usage is not available in UCUM, curly braces should wrap the value, such as {value} ,
```
to follow UCUM parsing rules. For example, RPM is commonly used to report fan speeds in revolutions-per-minute,
```
and the preferred representation in UCUM is {rev}/min , but the value {RPM} is acceptable. For units with prefixes,
```
```
the case-sensitive ( c/s ) symbol for the prefix as listed in UCUM should be prepended to the unit symbol. For
```
```
example, the mebibyte (1024^2 bytes), which has the UCUM Mi prefix and By symbol, would use MiBy as the
```
value for the annotation. For values that also include rate information, such as megabits per second, the rate unit's
```
symbol should be appended and use a slash ( / ) character as a separator. For example, Mbit/s .
```
```
DEPRECATED: Previous versions of this specification recommended RPM as a commonly used unit of
```
measure for certain properties. New recommendations are provided that follow UCUM parsing rules.
9.13.11 Expanded resource annotation
The expanded resource annotation can be applied to a reference property to specify that the default behavior for the
service is to include the contents of the related resource or resource collection in responses. This behavior follows
the same semantics of the expand query parameter with a level of 1.
Reference properties annotated with this term shall be expanded by the service, even if not requested by the client. A
service may page resource collections.
9.13.12 Owning entity annotation
The owning entity annotation can be applied to a schema to specify the name of the entity responsible for
development, publication, and maintenance of a given schema.
9.13.13 Deprecated annotation
The deprecated annotation specifies if a property, enumeration, or other schema element has been deprecated.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
118 Published Version 1.23.0
Schema elements marked as deprecated contain a schema version that shows when the element was deprecated,
as well as text that specifies the favored approach.
The deprecated annotation also specifies if resource URI patterns have been deprecated. Deprecated resource URI
patterns shall also be included in the resource URI patterns annotation.
Existing and new implementations may use deprecated schema elements or URIs, but they should move to the
favored approach. Deprecated schema elements may be implemented to achieve backwards compatibility.
Deprecated schema elements may be removed from the next major version of the schema.
9.13.14 URI segment annotation
The URI segment annotation can be applied to a reference property to specify the segment appended to the URI of
the resource when constructing the URI of a subordinate resource if the segment differs from the property name. For
more information, see the URI naming rules clause.
9.13.15 URI annotation
The URI annotation can be applied to a string property to indicate the property value contains a URI. This is used for
cases where a service provides a hyperlink to a URI outside of the Redfish model or where a reference property is
not used to avoid undesireable expansion.
9.14 Versioning
As stated previously, a resource can be an individual entity or a resource collection, which acts as a container for a
set of resources.
A resource collection does not contain any version information because it defines a single Members property, and the
overall collection definition never grows over time.
A resource has both unversioned and versioned definitions.
References from other resources use the unversioned definition of a resource to ensure no version dependencies
exist between the definitions. The unversioned definition of a resource contains no property information about the
resource.
The versioned definition of a resource contains a set of properties, actions, and other definitions associated with the
resource. The version of a resource follows the format:
v<X>.<Y>.<Z>
where
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 119
â¢ <X> is an integer that represents the major version. Indicates a backward-incompatible change.
â¢ <Y> is an integer that represents the minor version. Indicates a minor update. Redfish introduces new
functionality but does not remove any functionality. The minor version preserves compatibility with earlier minor
versions. For example, a new property introduces a new minor version of the resource.
â¢ <Z> is an integer that represents the errata version. Indicates a fix in an earlier version. For example, a fix to a
schema annotation on a property introduces an errata version of the resource.
9.15 Localization
The creation of separate localized copies of Redfish schemas and registries is allowed and encouraged. Localized
schema and registry files may be submitted to DMTF for republication in the Redfish schema repository.
Property names, parameter names, and enumeration values in the JSON response payload are never localized but
translated copies of those names may be provided as additional annotations in the localized schema for use by client
applications. A separate file for each localized schema or registry shall be provided for each supported language.
The English-language versions of Redfish schemas and registries shall be the normative versions, and alterations of
meaning due to translation in localized versions of schemas and registries shall be forbidden.
Schemas and registries in non-English languages shall use the appropriate schema annotations to identify their
language. Descriptive property, parameter, and enumeration text not translated into the specified language shall be
removed from localized versions. This removal enables software and tools to combine normative and localized
copies, especially for minor schema version differences.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
120 Published Version 1.23.0
10 File naming and publication
For consistency in publication and to enable programmatic access, all Redfish-related files shall follow a set of rules
to construct the name of each file. The Schema definition languages clause describes the file name construction
rules, while the following clauses describe the construction rules for other file types.
10.1 Registry file naming
Redfish message registry files, privilege registry files, and BIOS attribute registry files shall use the registry name to
construct the file name, in this format:
<RegistryName>.<MajorVersion>.<MinorVersion>.<Errata>.json
For example, the file name of the Base Message Registry v1.0.2 is Base.1.0.2.json .
The registry name should be unique to avoid conflict with other registry files. The clause OEM registries describes
registry name to use for OEM registry files.
10.2 Profile file naming
The document that describes a profile follows the Redfish schema file naming conventions. The file name format for
profiles shall be:
<ProfileName>.v<MajorVersion>_<MinorVersion>_<Errata>.json
For example, the file name of the BasicServer profile v1.2.0 is BasicServer.v1_2_0.json . The file name shall include
the profile name and version, which matches those property values within the document.
10.3 Dictionary file naming
The binary file describing a Redfish Device Enablement dictionary follows the Redfish schema file naming
conventions for the schema definition language that the dictionary is converted from. Because a single dictionary file
contains all minor revisions of the schema, only the major version appears in the file name. The file names for
Dictionaries shall be formatted as:
<DictionaryName>_v<MajorVersion>.dict
For example, the file name of the Chassis dictionary v1.2.0 is Chassis_v1.dict .
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 121
10.4 Localized file naming
Localized schemas and registries shall follow the same file naming conventions as the English language versions.
When multiple localized copies are present in a repository and which have the same file name, files in languages
other than English shall be organized into sub-folders named to match the ISO 639-1 language code for those files.
English language files may be duplicated in an en sub-folder for consistency.
10.5 DMTF Redfish file repository
All Redfish schemas, registries, dictionaries, and profiles published or republished by DMTF's Redfish Forum are
available from the DMTF website for download. Programs may use the following durable URLs to access the
repository. Programs incorporating remote repository access should implement a local cache to reduce latency,
program requirements for Internet access and undue traffic burden on DMTF's website.
Organizations creating Redfish-related files such as OEM schemas, Redfish interoperability profiles, or message
registries are encouraged to use the form at https://redfish.dmtf.org/redfish/portal to submit those files to DMTF for
republication in DMTF's Redfish file repository.
Table 24 describes how files are organized on the site:

DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 123
11 Schema definition languages
Individual resources and their dependent types and actions are defined within a Redfish schema document. This
clause describes how these documents are constructed in the following formats:
â¢ OData Common Schema Definition Language
â¢ JSON Schema
â¢ OpenAPI
11.1 OData Common Schema Definition Language
11.1.1 OData Common Schema Definition Language overview
```
OData Common Schema Definition Language (CSDL) is an XML schema format defined by the OData CSDL
```
Specification. The following clause describes how Redfish uses CSDL to describe resources and resource
collections.
11.1.2 File naming conventions for CSDL
Redfish CSDL schema files shall be named using the resource type name for the schema, followed by _v and the
major version of the schema. Because a single CSDL schema file contains all minor revisions of the schema, only
the major version appears in the file name. The file name shall be formatted as:
<ResourceType>_v<MajorVersion>.xml
For example, version 1.3.0 of the Chassis schema is Chassis_v1.xml .
11.1.3 Core CSDL files
Table 25 describes the core CSDL files:
Table 25 â Core CSDL files
File Description
RedfishError_v1.xml Payload definition of the Redfish error response.
RedfishExtensions_v1.xml All definitions for Redfish types and annotations.
Resource_v1.xml All base definitions for resources, resource collections, and common properties, such asStatus .
Redfish Specification DSP0266
124 Published Version 1.23.0
11.1.4 CSDL format
The outer element of the OData schema representation document shall be the Edmx element, and shall have a
Version attribute with a value of 4.0 .
<edmx:Edmx xmlns:edmx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx" Version="4.0">
<!-- edmx:Reference and edmx:DataServices elements go here -->
</edmx:Edmx>
The Referencing other CSDL files and CSDL data services clauses describe the items that are found within the
Edmx element.
11.1.4.1 Referencing other CSDL files
CSDL files may use Reference tags to reference types defined in other CSDL documents.
The Reference element uses the Uri attribute to specify a CSDL file. The Reference element also contains one or
more Include tags that specify the Namespace attribute containing the types to be referenced, along with an optional
Alias attribute for that namespace.
Type definitions generally reference the OData and Redfish namespaces for common type annotation terms. Redfish
CSDL files shall contain the Alias attribute on the following namespaces:
â¢ Org.OData.Core.V1 is aliased as OData .
â¢ Org.OData.Measures.V1 is aliased as Measures .
â¢ RedfishExtensions.v1_0_0 is aliased as Redfish .
â¢ Validation.v1_0_0 is aliased as Validation .
<edmx:Reference
```
Uri="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/cs01/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.xml">

<edmx:Include Namespace="Resource"/>
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 125
<edmx:Include Namespace="Resource.v1_0_0"/>
</edmx:Reference>
11.1.4.2 CSDL data services
Define structures, enumerations, and other definitions in CSDL within a namespace. Use a Schema tag to define the
schema and use the Namespace attribute to declare the name of the namespace.
Redfish uses namespaces to differentiate different versions of the schema. CSDL enables structures to inherit from
other structures, which enables newer namespaces to define only the changes. The Elements of CSDL namespaces
clause describes this behavior.
Namespaces containing unversioned resource and resource collection definitions shall use the resource type to
name the namespace, in this format:
<ResourceType>
For example, the unversioned namespace of the Chassis resource is Chassis .
Namespaces containing versioned resource definitions shall use the resource type to name the namespace, in this
```
format:
```
<ResourceType>.v<MajorVersion>_<MinorVersion>_<Errata>
For example, the version 1.3.0 namespace of the Chassis resource is Chassis.v1_3_0 .
The Schema element is a child of the DataServices element, which is a child of the Edmx element:
<edmx:DataServices>
<Schema xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edm" Namespace="MyTypes.v1_0_0">
<!-- Type definitions for version 1.0.0 of MyTypes go here -->
</Schema>
<Schema xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edm" Namespace="MyTypes.v1_1_0">
<!-- Type definitions for version 1.1.0 of MyTypes go here -->
</Schema>
</edmx:DataServices>
11.1.5 Elements of CSDL namespaces
The following clauses describe the definitions within each namespace:
â¢ Qualified names
Redfish Specification DSP0266
126 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ Entity type and complex type elements
11.1.5.1 Qualified names
Many definitions in CSDL use references to qualified names. CSDL defines this as a string in the form:
<Namespace>.<TypeName>
where
â¢ <Namespace> is the namespace name.
â¢ <TypeName> is the name of the element in the namespace.
For example, if a reference is made to MyType.v1_0_0.MyDefinition , the definition can be found in the
MyType.v1_0_0 namespace with an element named MyDefinition .
11.1.5.2 Entity type and complex type elements
Use the EntityType and ComplexType tags to define the entity type and complex type elements, respectively. These
elements define a JSON structure and their set of properties by defining property elements and navigation property
elements within the EntityType or ComplexType tags.
All entity types and complex types shall contain a Name attribute, which specifies the name of the definition.
Entity types and complex types may contain a BaseType attribute, which specifies a qualified name. When the
BaseType attribute is present, all definitions of the referenced BaseType are available to the entity type or complex
type being defined.
All resources and resource collections shall be defined with the entity type element. Resources inherit from
Resource.v1_0_0.Resource , and resource collections inherit from Resource.v1_0_0.ResourceCollection .
All structured properties shall be defined with the complex type element or entity type element. Most structured
properties are defined with the complex type element. Some use the entity type element that inherits from
Resource.v1_0_0.ReferenceableMember . The entity type element enables references to be made by using the
Navigation Property element, whereas the complex type element does not allow for this usage.
Example entity type and complex type element:
<EntityType Name="TypeA" BaseType="Resource.v1_0_0.Resource">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="Entity description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.LongDescription" String="Entity normative description."/>
<!-- Property and navigation property definitions go here -->
</EntityType>
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 127
<ComplexType Name="PropertyTypeA">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="Structured property description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.LongDescription" String=Structured property normative description."/>
<!-- Property and navigation property definitions go here -->
</ComplexType>
11.1.5.3 Action element
Use the Action tag to define the action element. This element defines an action that can be performed on a
resource.
All Redfish actions shall be defined with the action element. All action elements shall contain a Name attribute, which
specifies the name of the action. The action shall be represented in payloads as the qualified name of the action,
preceded by # .
In Redfish, all action elements shall contain the IsBound attribute that is always set to true , which indicates that the
action appears as a member of a structured type.
The action element shall contain one or more Parameter tags that specify the Name and Type of each parameter.
Because all action elements in Redfish use the IsBound="true" term, the first parameter is called the binding
parameter and specifies the structured type to which the action belongs. All Redfish actions shall contain a binding
parameter. The binding parameter shall be one of the following complex type elements:
â¢ For standard actions, the Actions complex type for the resource.
â¢ For OEM actions, the OemActions complex type for the resource.
The remaining Parameter elements shall describe additional parameters to be passed to the action. The term
```
Nullable="false" in a parameter shall indicate the parameter is required in the action request body.
```
<Schema xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edm" Namespace="MyType">
<Action Name="MyAction" IsBound="true">
<Parameter Name="Thing" Type="MyType.Actions"/>
<Parameter Name="Parameter1" Type="Edm.Boolean"/>
<Parameter Name="Parameter2" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false"/>
</Action>
<ComplexType Name="Actions">
...
</ComplexType>
...
Redfish Specification DSP0266
128 Published Version 1.23.0
</Schema>
Some action parameters may specify a type that is defined by an entity type element. In these cases, the parameter
in the request is a reference object to a resource within the service.
11.1.5.4 Action element for OEM actions
OEM-specific actions shall be defined by using the action element with the binding parameter set to the OemActions
complex type for the resource. For example, the following definition defines the OEM #Contoso.Ping action for a
ComputerSystem .
<Schema xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edm" Namespace="Contoso">
<Action Name="Ping" IsBound="true">
<Parameter Name="ComputerSystem" Type="ComputerSystem.v1_0_0.OemActions"/>
</Action>
</Schema>
11.1.5.5 Action with a response body
A response body for an action shall be defined using the ReturnType tag within an action element. For example, the
following definition defines the GenerateTicket action with a response that contains the definition specified by
GenerateTicketResponse .
<Action Name="GenerateTicket" IsBound="true">
<Parameter Name="ExampleResource" Type="ExampleResource.v1_0_0.Actions"/>
...
<ReturnType Type="ExampleResource.v1_0_0.GenerateTicketResponse" Nullable="false"/>
</Action>
<ComplexType Name="GenerateTicketResponse">
<Annotation Term="OData.AdditionalProperties" Bool="false"/>
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="The response body for GenerateTicket."/>
<Property Name="TicketId" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false">
<Annotation Term="OData.Permissions" EnumMember="OData.Permission/Read"/>
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="The ticket identifier."/>
<Annotation Term="Redfish.Required"/>
</Property>
</ComplexType>
Using the above example, the following payload is an example response for the GenerateTicket action.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 129
```
{
```
"TicketId": "40478281bd0f6b9e7131db6c4f673438"
```
}
```
11.1.5.6 Property element
Properties of resources, resource collections, and structured properties are defined using the property element. The
Property tag defines a property element inside entity type and complex type elements.
All property elements shall contain a Name attribute, which specifies the name of the property.
All property elements shall contain a Type attribute specifies the data type. The Type attribute shall be one of the
following names or types:
â¢ A qualified name that references an enum type element.
â¢ A qualified name that references a complex type element.
â¢ A primitive data type.
â¢ An array of the previous names or types by using the Collection term.
Table 26 describes the primitive data types:
Table 26 â Primitive data types
Type Meaning
Edm.Boolean True or False.
Edm.DateTimeOffset Date-time string.
Edm.Decimal Number, optionally containing a decimal point.
Edm.Double Number, optionally containing a decimal point and optionally containing an exponent.
Edm.Duration Duration string.
Edm.Guid GUID/UUID string.
Edm.Int64 Signed 64-bit integer.
Edm.String UTF-8 string.
Property elements may specify a Nullable attribute. If the attribute is false , the property shall not contain null . If
the attribute is true or absent, the property may contain null .
Example property element:
Redfish Specification DSP0266
130 Published Version 1.23.0
<Property Name="Property1" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="Property1 description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.LongDescription" String="Property1 normative description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.Permissions" EnumMember="OData.Permission/Read"/>
<Annotation Term="Redfish.Required"/>
<Annotation Term="Measures.Unit" String="Watts"/>
</Property>
11.1.5.7 Navigation property element
Reference properties of resources, resource collections, and structured properties are defined using the navigation
property element. The NavigationProperty tag defines a navigation property element inside entity type and complex
type elements.
All navigation property elements shall contain a Name attribute, which specifies the name of the property.
All navigation property elements shall contain a Type attribute specifies the data type. The Type attribute shall be a
qualified name that references an entity type element. The Collection term with the qualified name shall indicate
the property is an array.
Navigation property elements may specify a Nullable attribute. If the attribute is false , the property shall not
contain null . If the attribute is true or absent, the property may contain null .
Unless the reference property is to be expanded, all navigation properties in Redfish shall contain the
OData.AutoExpandReferences annotation element to show that the reference is always available.
Example navigation property element:
<NavigationProperty Name="RelatedType" Type="MyTypes.TypeB">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="RelatedType description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.LongDescription" String="RelatedType normative description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.AutoExpandReferences"/>
</NavigationProperty>
11.1.5.8 Enum type element
Use the EnumType tag to define the enum type element. This element defines a set of enumeration values, which
may be applied to one or more properties.
All enum type elements shall contain a Name attribute, which specifies the name of the set of enumeration values.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 131
Enum type elements shall contain Member tags that define the members of the enumeration. The Member tags shall
contain a Name attribute that specifies the string value of the member name.
<EnumType Name="EnumTypeA">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="EnumTypeA type description."/>
<Annotation Term="OData.LongDescription" String="EnumTypeA type normative description."/>
<Member Name="MemberA">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="The description of MemberA"/>
</Member>
<Member Name="MemberB">
<Annotation Term="OData.Description" String="The description of MemberB"/>
</Member>
</EnumType>
11.1.5.9 Annotation element
Annotations in CSDL are expressed using the Annotation tag. Any schema element in CSDL may contain
annotations.
The following examples show how each Redfish schema annotation is expressed in CSDL.
â¢ The OData Core Schema defines terms with the OData prefix.
â¢ The OData Measures Schema defines terms with the Measures prefix.
â¢ The RedfishExtensions Schema defines terms with the Redfish prefix.

11.2 JSON Schema
11.2.1 JSON Schema overview
The JSON Schema Specification defines a JSON format for describing JSON payloads. The following clause
describes how Redfish uses JSON Schema to describe resources and resource collections.
11.2.2 File naming conventions for JSON Schema
Each Redfish JSON Schema file represents a single resource type.
Versioned Redfish JSON Schema files shall use the resource type to name the file, in this format:
<ResourceType>.v<MajorVersion>_<MinorVersion>_<Errata>.json
For example, version 1.3.0 of the Chassis schema is Chassis.v1_3_0.json .

11.2.5 JSON Schema definitions body
This clause describes the types of definitions found in the definitions term of a Redfish JSON Schema file.
11.2.5.1 Resource definitions in JSON Schema
To satisfy versioning requirements, the JSON Schema representation of each resource shall have one unversioned
schema file and a set of versioned schema files.
The unversioned definition of a resource shall contain an anyOf statement. This statement shall consist of an array
of $ref terms, which point to the following definitions:
â¢ The JSON Schema definition for a reference property.
â¢ The versioned definitions of the resource.
The unversioned definition of a resource shall contain the uris term to express the allowable URIs for the resource,
and the deletable , insertable , and updatable terms to express the capabilities of the resource.
The following example shows an unversioned resource definition in JSON Schema:
```
{
```
```
"ComputerSystem": {
```
```
"anyOf": [{
```
"$ref": "http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/odata.v4_0_3.json#/definitions/idRef"
```
}, {

...
```
}
```
The versioned definition of a resource shall contain the property definitions for the given version of the resource.
11.2.5.2 Enumerations in JSON Schema
Table 29 describes the terms that constitute definitions for enumerations:
Table 29 â JSON Schema enumerations
Term Description
enum String array that contains the possible enumeration values.
enumDescriptions Object that contains the descriptions for each of the enumerations as name-value pairs.
enumLongDescriptions Object that contains the long descriptions for each of the enumerations as name-value pairs.
enumDeprecated Object that contains the deprecation guidance for each of the enumerations as name-valuepairs.
enumVersionDeprecated Object that contains the deprecation version information for each of the enumerations as name-value pairs.
type Because all enumerations in Redfish are strings, the type term always has the string value.
The following example shows an enumeration definition in JSON Schema:
```
{
```
```
"Flavors": {
```
"enum": ["Lit", "Blinking", "Off"],
```
"enumDescriptions": {
```
"Blinking": "The Indicator LED is blinking.",
"Lit": "The Indicator LED is lit.",
"Off": "The Indicator LED is off."
```
},
```
```
"enumLongDescriptions": {
```
"Blinking": "This value shall represent the Indicator LED is in a blinking state where the LED is
being turned on and off in repetition.",
"Lit": "This value shall represent the Indicator LED is in a solid on state.",

```
},
```
"type": "string"
```
},
```
...
Redfish Specification DSP0266
138 Published Version 1.23.0
```
}
```
11.2.5.3 Actions in JSON Schema
Versioned definitions of resources shall contain a definition called Actions . This definition is a container with a set of
terms that point to the different actions supported by the resource. The names of standard actions shall be in the
```
form:
```
#<ResourceType>.<ActionName>
Example Actions definition:
```
{
```
```
"Actions": {
```
"additionalProperties": false,
"description": "The available actions for this resource.",
"longDescription": "This type shall contain the available actions for this resource.",

```
}
```
```
},
```
"type": "object"
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
Another definition within the same schema file shall describe the action itself. This definition shall contain a term
called parameters to describe the client request body. It also shall contain property definitions for the target and
title properties shown in response payloads for the resource.
The following example shows a definition of an action:
```
{
```
```
"Reset": {
```
"additionalProperties": false,
"description": "This action resets the system.",
"longDescription": "This action shall perform a reset of the ComputerSystem.",

"description": "Friendly action name",
"type": "string"
```
}
```
```
},
```
"type": "object"
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
Action parameters may specify a type that is a resource definition. In these cases, the parameter in the request shall
contain a reference object to a resource within the service.
11.2.5.4 OEM actions in JSON Schema
OEM-specific actions shall be defined by using an action definition in an appropriately named JSON Schema file. For
example, the following definition defines the OEM #ContosoNetworkDevice.Ping action, assuming it's found in the
versioned ContosoNetworkDevice JSON Schema file, such as ContosoNetworkDevice.v1_0_0.json .
```
{
```
```
"Ping": {
```
"additionalProperties": false,
```
"parameters": {},
```
```
"properties": {
```
```
"target": {
```
"description": "Link to invoke action",
"format": "uri",
"type": "string"
```
},
```
```
"title": {
```
"description": "Friendly action name",
"type": "string"
```
}
```
```
},
```
"type": "object"
```
},
```
...
```
}
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266
140 Published Version 1.23.0
11.2.5.5 Action with a response body
A response body for an action shall be defined using the actionResponse term within the action definition. For
example, the following definition defines the GenerateTicket action with a response that contains the definition
specified by #/definitions/GenerateTicketResponse .
```
{
```
```
"GenerateTicket": {
```
```
"actionResponse": {
```
"$ref": "#/definitions/GenerateTicketResponse"
```
},
```
```
"parameters": {}
```
```
},
```
```
"GenerateTicketResponse": {
```
"additionalProperties": false,
"description": "The response body for GenerateTicket.",
```
"properties": {
```
```
"TicketId": {
```
"description": "The ticket identifier.",
"readonly": true,
"type": "string"
```
}
```
```
},
```
"required": ["TicketId"],
"type": "object"
```
}
```
```
}
```
In the previous example, the following payload is an example response for the GenerateTicket action.
```
{
```
"TicketId": "40478281bd0f6b9e7131db6c4f673438"
```
}

11.3 OpenAPI
11.3.1 OpenAPI overview
The OpenAPI Specification defines a format for describing JSON payloads and the set of URIs a client can access
on a service. The following clause describes how Redfish uses OpenAPI to describe resources and resource
collections.
11.3.2 File naming conventions for OpenAPI schema
Each Redfish OpenAPI file represents a single resource type.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
142 Published Version 1.23.0
Versioned Redfish OpenAPI files shall be named using the resource type name for the schema, following the format:
<ResourceType>.v<MajorVersion>_<MinorVersion>_<Errata>.yaml
For example, version 1.3.0 of the Chassis schema is Chassis.v1_3_0.yaml .
Unversioned Redfish OpenAPI files shall use the resource type name to name the file, in this format:
<ResourceType>.yaml
For example, the unversioned definition of the Chassis schema is Chassis.yaml .
11.3.3 Core OpenAPI schema files
Table 31 describes the core OpenAPI schema files:
Table 31 â Core OpenAPI schema files
File Description
odata-v4.yaml Definitions for common OData properties.
openapi.yaml URI paths and their respective payload structures.
Resource.yaml and its subsequent versions All base definitions for resources, resource collections, and commonproperties, such as Status .
11.3.4 openapi.yaml
The openapi.yaml file is the starting point for clients to understand the construct of the service.
Table 32 describes the terms that the openapi.yaml file contains:
Table 32 â openapi.yaml terms
Term Description
components Global definitions. For Redfish, contains the format of the Redfish error response.
info Structure consisting of information about what the openapi.yaml is describing, such as the author of the file and anycontact information.
openapi Version of OpenAPI the document follows.
paths URIs supported by the document, with possible methods, response bodies, and request bodies.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 143
The service shall return the openapi.yaml file, if present in the Redfish service, as a YAML document by using either
```
the application/yaml or application/vnd.oai.openapi MIME types. The service may append ;charset=utf-8 to
```
the MIME type. Note that while the application/yaml type is in common use today, the application/
vnd.oai.openapi type was recently defined and approved specifically to support OpenAPI. Implementations should
use caution when selecting the MIME type as this specification may change in the future to reflect adoption of the
OpenAPI-defined MIME type.
The paths term shall contain an array of the possible URIs. Each URI shall contain methods supported by the URI.
Each method shall contain the possible response bodies and request bodies.

11.4 Schema modification rules
Schema referenced from the implementation may vary from the canonical definitions of those schema defined by the
Redfish schema or other entities, provided they adhere to the following rules. Clients should take this into
consideration when attempting operations on the resources defined by schema.
â¢ Modified schema may constrain a read/write property to be read only.
â¢ Modified schema may constrain a property by adding length annotations to properties that do not have those
annotations.
â¢ Modified schema may constrain a property by adding a pattern annotation to properties that do not have that
annotation.
â¢ Modified schema may constrain the capabilities of a resource or resource collection to remove support for HTTP
operations.
â¦ Modified schema may change the update capabilities to indicate a client can perform a PATCH or PUT
request on the resource to support writable OEM properties.
â¢ Modified schema may remove properties that are not required.
â¢ Modified schema may remove actions.
â¢ Modified schema may remove action parameters that are not required.
â¢ Modified schema may change description annotations.
â¢ Modified schema may change any external references to point to Redfish schema that adheres to the
modification rules.
â¢ Modified schema may change the owning entity annotation to specify who made the modifications.
â¢ Modified schema may remove URIs from the resource URI patterns annotation.
â¢ Modified schema may add URIs to the resource URI patterns annotation to define OEM URIs for standard
resources and shall follow the OEM URI rules specified by the OEM URIs clause.
â¢ Modified schema may alter non-semantic text, such as spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
â¢ Other modifications to the schema shall not be allowed.
Services that collect and surface schema files from managed devices, such as when aggregating other services,
shall handle cases where different devices contain different modifications to the same schema file. This specification
does not require a specific method to resolve these conflicts, but some options include:
â¢ Merging the schema files from the managed devices.
â¢ Replacing the schema files from the managed devices with unmodified schema files.

12 Service details
12.1 Eventing
12.1.1 Eventing overview
This clause describes how to use the REST-based mechanism to subscribe to and receive event messages.
```
Note: For security implications of eventing, see the Security details clause.
```
The Redfish service requires a client or administrator to create subscriptions to receive events.
To create a subscription, use one of these methods:
â¢ Directly HTTP POST to the subscription collection.
```
â¢ Indirectly open a server-sent events (SSE) connection for the event service.
```
12.1.2 POST to subscription collection
To locate the event service, the client traverses the Redfish service interface. The event service is located in the
service root, as described in the ServiceRoot schema.
After the client discovers the service, they perform an HTTP POST on the resource collection URI for Subscriptions
in the event service to subscribe to events. For the subscription body syntax, see the Redfish EventDestination
schema. This request includes:
â¢ The URI where an event-receiver client expects events to be sent. When an event is triggered within the Redfish
service, the service sends an event to that URI.
â¢ The type of events to send.
If the subscription request succeeds, the service shall return:
â¢ An HTTP 201 Created status code.
â¢ The Location header that contains a URI of the newly created subscription resource.
If the subscription request succeeds, the service should return:
â¢ A response body containing a representation of the subscription resource that conforms to the
EventDestination schema.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 151
After a subscription is registered with the service, clients begin receiving events. Clients do not receive events
retroactively. The service does not retain historical events.
Services shall:
â¢ Support push style eventing for all resources that can send events.
â¢ Respond to a request to create a subscription with an error if the body of the request is conflicting. For instance,
if parameters in the request are not supported, the service shall return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.
â¢ Retain subscriptions as persistent across service restarts.
Services shall not:
â¢ Push events by using HTTP POST unless an event subscription has been created. To terminate the event
stream at any time, either the client or the service can delete the subscription.
```
â¢ Send a push event payload larger than 1 Mebibyte (MiB). If more than 1 MiB of data is to be sent, the service
```
shall divide the payload on the nearest Event entry such that the total payload transmitted to the client is less
than 1 MiB. This restriction shall not apply to metric reports.
Services may:
â¢ Terminate a subscription by sending a SubscriptionTerminated message from the Base Message Registry as
the last event.
â¢ Terminate a subscription if the number of delivery errors exceeds pre-configured thresholds.
To unsubscribe from the events associated with this subscription, the client or administrator shall perform an HTTP
DELETE request to the subscription's resource URI.
Subsequent requests to subscription resources that have been terminated respond with the HTTP 404 Not Found
status code.
Some configurable properties define the behavior for all event subscriptions. For details, see the Redfish
EventService schema.
```
DEPRECATED: Previous versions of the specification required services to reject subscription requests if
```
RegistryPrefixes and MessageIds were in the same request.
12.1.3 Open an SSE connection
A service may support the ServerSentEventUri property in the EventService resource. If a client performs a GET
request on the URI that the ServerSentEventUri contains, an SSE connection opens for the client. For details about
this method, see the server-sent events Event service clause.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
152 Published Version 1.23.0
12.1.4 EventType-based eventing

similar to when ETags are changed and implementations might not send
an event for every resource change.
For example, if an event is sent for every Ethernet packet that is received
or each time that a sensor changes one degree, more events than fit in a
scalable interface are generated.
Alert
An event of some significance happens.
Depending on the resource, may be
generated directly or indirectly.
Usually adopts a message registry approach similar to extended error
handling in that a MessageId is included.
An example of an alert event is, a chassis is opened, a button is pushed, a
cable is unplugged, or a threshold exceeded.
These events usually do not correspond well to life cycle-type events.
Therefore, alerts have their own category.
Metric report The telemetry service generates orupdates a metric report.
Generated as specified by the MetricReportDefinition resources found
subordinate to the telemetry service. Can occur periodically, on demand, or
when changes are detected in the metric properties.
For details, see the Redfish MetricReportDefinition schema.

12.1.5 Subscribing to events
Table 37 describes the properties that a subscriber provides to subscribe to events and filter received messages:
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 153
Table 37 â Subscription properties
Property Description
MessageIds
An array of allowable values for MessageId in an event.
An event is sent to the subscriber if the MessageId of the event is contained in this array or is found in a
message registry referenced by RegistryPrefixes .
To not perform inclusive filtering based upon MessageId , provide an empty array.
The contents of the array should not include the major or minor version of the message registry. For
example, instead of Resource.1.2.ResourceCreated , use Resource.ResourceCreated .
RegistryPrefixes
An array of standard or OEM message registries containing the allowable values for MessageId in an
event.
An event is sent to the subscriber if the MessageId is found in a message registry in this array or is
contained in MessageIds .
To not perform inclusive filtering based upon the message registry of the MessageId , provide an empty
array.
The contents of the array does not include the registry version. For example, instead of Base.1.5.0 , use
Base .
ResourceTypes
An array of standard or OEM resource types.
An event is sent to the subscriber if the OriginOfCondition resource type matches one of the
ResourceTypes values.
To not perform filtering based upon the resource type of the OriginOfCondition , provide an empty array.
The contents of the array does not include the schema version. For example, instead of
Task.v1_2_0.Task , use Task .
OriginResources
An array of URIs to resources.
An event is sent to the subscriber if the OriginOfCondition property matches one of the URIs listed in
OriginResources . To include subordinate resources regardless of depth, set the SubordinateResources
property to true .
To not perform filtering based upon the URI of the OriginOfCondition , provide an empty array.
ExcludeMessageIds
An array of disallowed values for MessageId in an event.
An event is not sent to the subscriber if the MessageId of the event is contained in this array.
To not perform exclusive filtering based upon MessageId , provide an empty array.
The contents of the array should not include the major or minor version of the message registry. For
example, instead of Resource.1.2.ResourceCreated , use Resource.ResourceCreated .
Redfish Specification DSP0266
154 Published Version 1.23.0
Property Description
ExcludeRegistryPrefixes
An array of standard or OEM message registries containing the disallowed values for MessageId in an
event.
An event is not sent to the subscriber if the MessageId is found in a message registry in this array.
To not perform exclusive filtering based upon the message registry of the MessageId , provide an empty
array.
The contents of the array does not include the registry version. For example, instead of Base.1.5.0 , use
Base .
EventFormatType
The format that can be sent by using the EventFormatTypes property in the event service.
Represents the format of the payload sent to the event destination.
If the subscriber omits this value, the payload corresponds to the Event schema.
Clients can read the EventService resource of a service in order to determine what control properties in the previous
table are supported.
12.1.6 Event formats
Table 38 describes the event formats:
Table 38 â Event formats
Event format Description
Metric report message objects
Used when the telemetry service generates a new or updates an existing metric report. Metric
report message objects sent to the specified client endpoint shall contain the properties, as
described in the Redfish MetricReport schema.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 155
Event format Description
Event message objects
Used for all other types of events. Event message objects POST ed to the specified client endpoint
shall contain the properties as described in the Redfish Event schema. Supports a message
registry. In a message registry approach, a message registry lists the MessageIds in a well-known
format. These MessageIds are terse in nature and thus they are much smaller than actual
messages, making them suitable for embedded environments.
The registry also contains a message. The message itself can have arguments and default values
for severity and recommended actions. The MessageId property follows the format defined in the
MessageId format clause
Event messages may also have an EventGroupId property, which lets clients know that different
messages may be from the same event. For instance, if a LAN cable is disconnected, they may get
a specific message from one registry about the LAN cable being disconnected, another message
from a general registry about the resource changing, perhaps a message about resource state
change, and maybe more. For the client to determine whether these have the same root cause,
these messages have the same value for the EventGroupId property.
12.1.7 OEM extensions
OEMs can extend both messages and message registries. Any individual message, per the MessageRegistry
schema definition, define OEM sections. Thus, if OEMs wish to provide additional information or properties, use the
OEM section.
OEMs shall not supply additional message arguments beyond those in a standard message registry. OEMs may
substitute their own message registry for the standard registry to provide the OEM section within the registry but shall
not change the standard values, such as messages, in such registries.
12.2 Asynchronous operations
Services that support asynchronous operations implement the TaskService and Task resources.
The TaskService resource describes the service that handles task operations. It contains a resource collection of
zero or more Task resources. Each Task resource describes a long-running operation that is spawned when a
request takes longer than a few seconds, such as when a service is instantiated.
The Task schema defines task structure, including the start time, end time, task state, task status, and zero or more
task-associated messages.
Each task has a number of possible states, which are defined in the Task schema as the values for the TaskState
property.
When a client issues a request that results in a long-running operation, the service returns the HTTP 202 Accepted
Redfish Specification DSP0266
156 Published Version 1.23.0
status code and a Location header that contains a task monitor URI and, optionally, the Retry-After header that
defines the amount of time that the client should wait before querying the status of the operation. The 202 Accepted
response should include a response body. If a response body is provided, it shall contain a representation of the
Task resource that represents the state of the operation.
The task monitor is an opaque, service-generated URI provided to the client that initiated the request. To query the
status of an operation and determine when the operation has been completed and whether it succeeded, the client
performs a GET request on the task monitor URI from the Location header of the response from the initial HTTP
operation. The client should not include the application/http MIME type in the Accept header.
The task monitor URI should be in the format:
/redfish/v1/TaskService/TaskMonitors/<TaskMonitorId>
where
â¢ <TaskMonitorId> is an opaque identifier for the task monitor.
As long as the operation is in process, the service shall return the HTTP 202 Accepted status code when the client
performs a GET request on the task monitor URI.
If a service supports cancellation of a task, the Allow header shall contain DELETE for the task monitor. To cancel
the operation, the client may perform a DELETE request on the task monitor URI. The service determines when to
delete the associated Task resource. The client may also perform a DELETE request on the Task resource to
cancel the operation. Deleting the Task resource may invalidate the associated task monitor. A subsequent GET
request on the task monitor URI returns either the HTTP 410 Gone or 404 Not Found status code.
In the unlikely event that a DELETE of the task monitor or Task resource returns the HTTP 202 Accepted status
code, an additional task shall not be started and instead the client may monitor the existing Task resource for the
status of the cancellation request. When the task finally completes cancellation, operations on the task monitor URI
and Task resources shall return the HTTP 404 Not Found status code.
After the operation has been completed, the service shall update the TaskState in the Task resource with the
appropriate value. In addition, the task monitor shall return:
â¢ The appropriate HTTP status code, such as but not limited to 200 OK for most operations or 201 Created for
POST to create a resource.
â¢ The headers and response body of the initial operation, as if it had completed synchronously.
If the initial operation fails, the response body shall contain an error response.
If the operation has been completed and the service has already deleted the task, the service may return the HTTP
410 Gone or 404 Not Found status code. This situation can occur if the client waits too long to read the task monitor.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 157
To continue to get status information, the client can use the resource identifier from the 202 Accepted response to
directly query the Task resource.
â¢ Services that support asynchronous operations shall implement the Task resource.
â¢ The response to an asynchronous operation shall return the HTTP 202 Accepted status code and set the
Location response header to the URI of a task monitor associated with the task. The response may also
include the Retry-After header that defines the amount of time that the client should wait before polling for
status. If a response body is provided, it shall contain a representation of the Task resource.
â¢ GET requests to either the task monitor or Task resource shall return the current status of the operation without
blocking.
â¢ HTTP GET , PUT , and PATCH operations should always be synchronous.
â¢ Clients shall be prepared to handle both synchronous and asynchronous responses for HTTP GET , PUT ,
PATCH , POST , and DELETE requests.
â¢ Services shall persist pending tasks produced by client requests containing @Redfish.OperationApplyTime
across service restarts, until the task begins execution.
â¢ Tasks that are pending execution should include the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime property to indicate when the
task will start. If the @Redfish.OperationApplyTime value is AtMaintenanceWindowStart or
InMaintenanceWindowOnReset , the task should also include the @Redfish.MaintenanceWindow property.
â¦ Services shall reject modification requests to the @Redfish.MaintenanceWindow property in the Task
resource.
â¦ Changing the maintenance window for a resource may not affect existing tasks.
12.3 Resource tree stability
The resource tree, which is defined as the set of URIs and array elements within the implementation, should be
consistent on a single service across device resets or power cycles, and should withstand a reasonable amount of
configuration change, such as adding an adapter to a server.
The resource tree on one service might not be consistent across instances of devices. The client should traverse the
data model and discover resources to interact with them.
Some resources might remain very stable from system to system, such as manager network settings. However, the
architecture does not guarantee this stability.
â¢ A resource tree should remain stable across service restarts and minor device configuration changes. Thus, the
set of URIs and array element indexes should remain constant.
â¢ A client shall not expect the resource tree to be consistent between instances of services.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
158 Published Version 1.23.0
12.4 Discovery
12.4.1 Discovery overview
To support automatic discovery of managed devices that implement Redfish, services may implement the Simple
```
Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) defined by the UPnP Device Architecture 2.0 Specification. This protocol enables
```
network-efficient discovery without resorting to ping-sweeps, router table searches, or restrictive DNS naming
schemes. Use of SSDP is optional and, if implemented, shall enable the user to disable the protocol through the
ManagerNetworkProtocol resource.
The objective of discovery is for client software to locate managed devices that conform to the Redfish Specification.
Therefore, the primary SSDP functionality is incorporated in the M-SEARCH query. Redfish also follows the SSDP
extensions and naming that UPnP uses, where applicable, so that systems that conform to the Redfish Specification
can also implement UPnP without conflict.
12.4.2 UPnP compatibility
For compatibility with general-purpose SSDP client software, primarily UPnP, the service should use UDP port 1900
```
for all SSDP traffic. In addition, the Time-to-Live (TTL) hop count setting for SSDP multicast messages should default
```
to 2 .
12.4.3 USN format
The UUID in the USN field of the service shall equal the UUID property in the service root. If multiple or redundant
managers exist, the UUID of the service shall remain static regardless of redundancy failover. The unique ID shall be
in the canonical UUID format, followed by ::dmtf-org .
12.4.4 M-SEARCH response
```
The Redfish service Search Target (ST) is defined as:
```
```
urn:dmtf-org:service:redfish-rest:1
```
```
The managed device shall respond to M-SEARCH queries for Search Target (ST) of the Redfish service, as well as
```
```
ssdp:all . For UPnP compatibility, the managed device should respond to M-SEARCH queries for Search Target
```
```
(ST) of upnp:rootdevice .
```
The URN provided in the ST header in the reply shall use the redfish-rest: service name followed by the major
version of the Redfish Specification. If the minor version of the Redfish Specification to which the service conforms is
```
a non-zero value, the service may append the minor version with a preceding colon ( : ).
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 159
```
Note: Previous versions of the specification required the minor version in responses, such as redfish-rest:1:4
```
if the service conforms to Redfish Specification v1.4. However, this conficts with UPnP, which requires the
version in the response to match the version from the request. This is to allow for backwards compatible devices
to present themselves as the requested version.
The managed device shall provide clients with the AL header that points to the Redfish service root URL.
For UPnP compatibility, the managed device should provide clients with the Location header that points to the
UPnP XML descriptor.
The response to an M-SEARCH multicast or unicast query shall use the following format:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL:max-age=<MaxAgeSeconds>
```
ST:urn:dmtf-org:service:redfish-rest:1
```
```
USN:uuid:<ServiceUUID>::urn:dmtf-org:service:redfish-rest:1
```
```
AL:<ServiceRootURI>
```
```
EXT:
```
where
â¢ <MaxAgeSeconds> is the number of seconds caches can store the response and is at least 1800 .
â¢ <ServiceUUID> is the UUID of the Redfish service, such as 92384634-2938-2342-8820-489239905423 .
â¢ <ServiceRootURI> is the absolute URI of the Redfish service root, such as https://192.168.1.50/redfish/v1/ .
A service may provide additional headers for UPnP compatibility.
12.4.5 Notify, alive, and shutdown messages
Redfish devices may implement the additional UPnP-defined SSDP messages to announce their availability to
software. If implemented, services shall allow the end user to disable the traffic separately from the M-SEARCH
response functionality. This capability enables users to use the discovery functionality with minimal amounts of
generated network traffic.
12.5 Server-sent events
12.5.1 General
```
Server-sent events (SSE), defined by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG),
```
enables a client to open a connection with a web service. The web service can continuously push data to the client,
as needed.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
160 Published Version 1.23.0
Successful resource responses for SSE shall:
â¢ Return the HTTP 200 OK status code.
```
â¢ Have a Content-Type header set as text/event-stream or text/event-stream;charset=utf-8 .
```
Unsuccessful resource responses for SSE shall:
â¢ Return an HTTP 400 or greater status code.
```
â¢ Have a Content-Type header set as application/json or application/json;charset=utf-8 .
```
â¢ Contain a JSON object in the response body, as described in Error responses, which details the error or errors.
A service may occasionally send a comment within a stream to keep the connection alive. Services shall separate
events with blank lines. Blank lines should be sent as part of the end of an event, otherwise dispatch may be delayed
in conforming consumers.
The following clauses describe how Redfish uses SSE in different Redfish data model contexts. For details about
SSE, see the HTML5 Specification.
12.5.2 Event service
A service's implementation of the EventService resource may contain the ServerSentEventUri property. If a client
performs a GET request on the URI specified by the ServerSentEventUri property, the service shall keep the
connection open and conform to the HTML5 Specification until the client closes the socket. Service-generated events
shall be sent to the client by using the open connection.
When a client opens an SSE stream for the event service, the service shall create an EventDestination resource in
the Subscriptions collection for the event service to represent the connection. The Context property in the
EventDestination resource shall be a service-generated opaque string.
The service shall delete the corresponding EventDestination resource when the connection is closed. The service
shall close the connection if the corresponding EventDestination resource is deleted.
The service shall use the id field in the SSE stream to uniquely identify a payload in the SSE stream. The value of
the id field is determined by the service. A service should accept the Last-Event-ID header from the client to allow
a client to restart the event stream in case the connection is interrupted.
The service shall use the data field in the SSE stream based on the payload format. The SSE streams have these
```
formats:
```
â¢ Metric report SSE stream. Services shall use this format when the telemetry service generates or updates a
metric report.
â¢ Event message SSE stream. Services shall use this format for all other types of events.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 161
To reduce the amount of data returned to the client, the service should support the $filter query parameter in the
URI for the SSE stream.
```
Note: The $filter syntax shall follow the format in the $filter query parameter clause.
```
The service should support these properties as filter criteria:
â¢ EventFormatType
The service sends events of the matching EventFormatType .
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=EventFormatType eq 'Event'
```
Valid values are the EventFormatType enumerated string values that the Redfish EventService schema defines.
â¢ EventType
The service sends events of the matching EventType .
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=EventType eq 'StatusChange'
```
Valid values are the EventType enumerated string values that the Redfish Event schema defines.
â¢ MessageId
The service sends events with the matching MessageId .
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=MessageId eq 'Contoso.1.0.TempAssert'
```
â¢ MetricReportDefinition
The service sends metric reports generated from the MetricReportDefinition .
```
Example:
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266
162 Published Version 1.23.0
```
https://sseuri?$filter=MetricReportDefinition eq '/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/
```
MetricReportDefinitions/PowerMetrics'
â¢ OriginResource
The service sends events for the resource.
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=OriginResource eq '/redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Thermal'
```
â¢ RegistryPrefix
The service sends events with messages that are part of the RegistryPrefix .
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=(RegistryPrefix eq 'Resource') or (RegistryPrefix eq 'Task')
```
â¢ ResourceType
The service sends events for resources that match the ResourceType .
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=(ResourceType eq 'Power') or (ResourceType eq 'Thermal')
```
â¢ SubordinateResources
When SubordinateResources is true and OriginResource is specified, the service sends events for the
resource and its subordinate resources.
```
Example:
```
```
https://sseuri?$filter=(OriginResource eq '/redfish/v1/Systems/1') and (SubordinateResources eq
```
```
true)
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 163
To allow a client to expand the resource referenced by the OriginOfCondition property in the event payload, the
service should support the includeoriginofcondition query parameter in the URI for the SSE stream. For example:
```
https://sseuri?includeoriginofcondition
```
12.5.2.1 Event message SSE stream
The service shall use the data field in the SSE stream to include the JSON representation of the Event object.
The following example payload shows a stream that contains a single event with the id field set to 1 , and a data
field that contains a single Event object.
```
id: 1

12.5.2.2 Metric report SSE stream
The service shall use the data field in the SSE stream to include the JSON representation of the MetricReport
object.

12.6 WebSocket inbound access
12.6.1 Overview
RFC6455-defined WebSockets allows a client to open a bidirectional connection with a web service. The web service
can continuously communicate bidirectionally with the client. Services may implement properties that contain a
WebSocket URI, such as the WebSocket property in the ComputerSystem resource. The description and long
description annotations for these properties contain additional behaviors associated with the WebSocket.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 165
12.6.2 Connecting to a WebSocket
To establish a WebSocket connection, a client performs a GET operation on the WebSocket URI described in the
data model. Successful responses shall:
â¢ Return the HTTP 101 Switching Protocols status code.
â¢ Include the Connection response header with the value Upgrade as described in RFC6455.
â¢ Include the Upgrade response header with the value websocket as described in RFC6455.
Unsuccessful GET operation responses on the WebSocket URI shall:
â¢ Return an HTTP 400 or greater status code.
â¢ Include the Content-Type response header with the value application/json or application/
```
json;charset=utf-8 .
```
â¢ Include an extended error to describe the error in the response body as defined in the Error responses clause.
12.6.3 Data transmission on an established WebSocket
```
Services shall respond to ping ( 0x9 ) opcodes with a pong ( 0xA ) opcode. Services should occasionally send the
```
```
ping ( 0x9 ) opcode to the client to keep the connection alive.
```
Services and clients shall fragment and send bytes on implementation-defined boundaries as a series of binary data
frames as described by section 5.6 of RFC6455.
12.7 Update service
12.7.1 Overview
This clause covers the mechanism for software updates by using the update service.
12.7.2 Software update types
Clients can use these methods to update software through the update service:
â¢ Simple updates: The service pulls the update from a client-indicated network location.
â¢ Multipart HTTP push updates: The client uses HTTP or HTTPS with a multipart-formatted request body to push
a software image to the service.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
166 Published Version 1.23.0
12.7.2.1 Simple updates
A service can support the SimpleUpdate action within the UpdateService resource. A client can perform a POST
request on the action target URI to initiate a pull-based update, as defined by the UpdateService schema. After a
successful POST , the service should return the HTTP 202 Accepted status code with the Location header set to the
URI of a task monitor. Clients can use this task to monitor the progress and results of the update, which includes the
progress of image transfer to the service, as described in the Asynchronous operations clause.
12.7.2.2 Multipart HTTP push updates
A service may support the MultipartHttpPushUri property within the UpdateService resource. A client can perform
an HTTP or HTTPS POST request on the URI specified by this property to initiate a push-based update.
â¢ Access to this URI shall require the same privilege as access to the update service.
â¢ A client POST to this URI shall contain the Content-Type HTTP header with the value multipart/form-data ,
with the body formatted as defined by this specification. For more information about multipart/form-data HTTP
requests, see RFC7578.
â¢ The client POST request shall contain the binary image as one of the parts in a multipart/form-data request
body, as defined by Table 39. In addition, the request shall include action parameters for the update in a JSON
formatted part in the same multipart/form-data request body, as defined by Table 39. If the request has no
action parameters, an empty JSON object shall be used.
â¢ A service may require the Content-Length HTTP header for POST requests to this URI. In this case, if a client
does not include the required Content-Length header in the POST request, the service shall return the HTTP
411 Length Required status code.
â¢ A service should return the HTTP 413 Payload Too Large status code if the size of the binary image is larger
than the maximum image size that the service supports, as advertised in MaxImageSizeBytes property in the
UpdateService resource.
â¢ A service should return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with the
ActionParameterNotSupported message from the Base Message Registry if the UpdateParameters form contains
a parameter that it does not support.
â¢ After a successful POST to this URI, the service shall return the HTTP 202 Accepted status code with a
Location header set to the URI of a task monitor. Clients can use this task to monitor the progress and results
of the update, as described in the Asynchronous operations clause.
â¢ Upon completion of the requested update, the service shall return the HTTP 200 OK status code and an error
response, with a message that indicates success or any additional relevant messages, or the HTTP 204 No
Content status code.
â¦ The service should return the HTTP 200 OK status code. If the update was successfully processed and
completed without errors, warnings, or other notifications for the client, the service should return the
UpdateSuccessful message from the Update Message Registry in the code property in the response body.
Table 39 describes the requirements of a multipart/form-data request body for an HTTP push software update. If
DSP0266 Redfish Specification

12.8 Import configuration data
12.8.1 Overview
This clause covers the mechanism for importing configuration data for a system or equipment.
12.8.2 Multipart HTTP push imports
A service may support a property in a resource, such as the MultipartImportConfigurationPushURI property in
ComputerSystem , to allow a client to push a vendor-specific configuration file. A client can perform an HTTP or
HTTPS POST request on these URIs to initiate a push-based configuration import.
â¢ Access to this URI shall require the same privilege as access to performing modification operations of the
resource that contains the property.
â¢ A client POST to this URI shall contain the Content-Type HTTP header with the value multipart/form-data ,
with the body formatted as defined by this specification. For more information about multipart/form-data HTTP
requests, see RFC7578.
â¢ The client POST request shall contain the configuration file as one of the parts in a multipart/form-data request
body, as defined by Table 40. In addition, the request shall include action parameters for the import in a JSON
formatted part in the same multipart/form-data request body, as defined by Table 40. If the request has no
action parameters, an empty JSON object shall be used.
â¢ A service may require the Content-Length HTTP header for POST requests to this URI. In this case, if a client
does not include the required Content-Length header in the POST request, the service shall return the HTTP
411 Length Required status code.
â¢ A service shall return the HTTP 413 Payload Too Large status code if the size of the configuration file is larger
than the maximum file size that the service supports.
â¢ A service shall return the HTTP 400 Bad Request status code and an error response with the
ActionParameterNotSupported message from the Base Message Registry if the ImportParameters form contains
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 169
a parameter that it does not support.
â¢ After a successful POST to this URI, the service shall return the HTTP 202 Accepted status code with a
Location header set to the URI of a task monitor. Clients can use this task to monitor the progress and results
of the import, as described in the Asynchronous operations clause.
â¢ Upon completion of the requested import, the service shall return the HTTP 200 OK status code and an error
response, with a message that indicates success or any additional relevant messages, or the HTTP 204 No
Content status code.
Table 40 describes the requirements of a multipart/form-data request body for an HTTP push configuration import.
If the Required column contains Yes, the service shall require the client to provide the request body part. Services
shall not require clients to provide request body parts that are not marked as required. If the Required column
contains No, the service may allow the client to provide the request body part. Services shall process all HTTP
header names in a case-insensitive manner.

12.9 Outbound connections
12.9.1 Overview
There are cases where it may not be possible for a client to directly connect to a Redfish service. One common
example is that the Redfish service is behind a firewall. Services may implement WebSocket-based outbound
connections to establish a tunnel between the service and a remote client. If supported, services shall implement the
OutboundConnectionCollection resource subordinate to the AccountService resource.
Clients may create new OutboundConnection resources to create WebSocket connections to remote clients. Remote
clients initiate Redfish requests to the service by encoding Redfish HTTP requests in the WebSocket payload over
this connection.
12.9.2 Establishing an outbound connection
The service shall establish a persistent RFC6455-defined WebSocket connection for each OutboundConnection
resource where ConnectionEnabled contains true with the configured authentication mechanism to the address
specified by the EndpointURI property. The service may apply proxy settings to the connection based on the
configuration of the ManagerNetworkProtocol resource.
The service shall include the HTTP headers specified in the PreUpgradeHTTPHeaders property in the initial HTTPS
request to establish the WebSocket, prior to the upgrade to a WebSocket. The service shall include the Sec-
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 171
WebSocket-Protocol request header and it shall contain the value Redfish . The following example shows an initial
HTTPS request from a service prior to the upgrade to a WebSocket:
GET /redfish HTTP/1.1
```
Host: clientapp.contoso.com:443
```
```
Upgrade: websocket
```
```
Connect: Upgrade
```
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: Redfish
Sec-WebSocket-Key: abcdefhijklmnop==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```
PreUpgradeHeader1: PreUpgradeHeader1Value
```
When a connection is established with the remote client, the service shall create a Session resource with the role
defined in the OutboundConnection resource.
If the connection terminates for any reason, any pending Redfish responses are dropped. Services shall re-establish
outbound connections:
â¢ Based on the RetryPolicy configuration of the OutboundConnection resource.
â¢ If the ConnectionEnabled property in the OutboundConnection resource is set to true .
12.9.3 MTLS for an outbound connection
MTLS is the preferred authentication mechanism to establish a secure connection. This is specified when the
Authentication property in the OutboundConnection resource contains MTLS . There are two sets of certificates in
the OutboundConnection resource: Certificates and ClientCertificates .
The certificates found in the collection referenced by the Certificates property are the certificates for the remote
client's WebSocket service endpoint, typically an HTTPS server with WebSockets enabled. Services shall verify the
identity of the WebSocket service during TLS handshaking with the contents of this collection. Services may perform
additional verification based on other factors, such as the configuration of the SecurityPolicy resource.
The certificates found in the collection referenced by the ClientCertificate property are the certificates the service
provides to the remote client's WebSocket service during TLS handshaking. In some cases, the service may provide
its IDEV-ID or LDEV-ID certificate. To verify the identity Redfish service during TLS handshaking, the remote client
hosting the WebSocket will need copies of these certificates.
12.9.4 Handling Redfish requests over an outbound connection
Section 5.2 of RFC6455 contains the WebSocket packet definition.
To send a Redfish request, the remote client shall provide the entire HTTP request, including the method, path,
version, and headers, in the "Payload data" portion of the WebSocket packet over the established connection. The
Redfish Specification DSP0266
172 Published Version 1.23.0
```
remote client shall specify either the text ( 0x1 ) opcode or binary ( 0x2 ) opcode in the request. The request should
```
```
specify the binary ( 0x2 ) opcode if the payload data is binary, such as a firmware image.
```
To send a Redfish response, the service shall provide the entire HTTP response, including the version, status code,
status message, and headers, in the "Payload data" portion of the WebSocket packet over the established
connection. The service shall provide the same opcode received in the request from the external client.
```
Services shall respond to ping ( 0x9 ) opcodes with a pong ( 0xA ) opcode. Services shall send the ping ( 0x9 )
```
opcode to the remote client at the interval specified by the WebSocketPingIntervalMinutes property.
The following example shows the contents of "Payload data" for a remote client performing an HTTP GET request on
the ServiceRoot resource:
GET /redfish/v1/ HTTP/1.1
```
Host: clientapp.contoso.com:443
```
```
Accept: application/json
```
Content-Type: application/json
The following example shows the contents of "Payload data" for a remote client performing an HTTP POST request
on the Reset action for a ComputerSystem resource:
POST /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset HTTP/1.1
```
Host: clientapp.contoso.com:443
```
```
Accept: application/json
```
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 27
```
{
```
"ResetType": "On"
```
}
```
12.9.5 Closing an outbound connection
The service shall close the WebSocket connection to the remote client if:
â¢ The Session resource representing the open connection to the remote client is deleted. The service shall also
set the ConnectionEnabled property in the OutboundConnection resource to false .
â¢ The OutboundConnection resource representing the outbound connection to the remote client is deleted. The
service shall also delete the respective Session resource.
â¢ The ConnectionEnabled property in the OutboundConnection resource is set to false . The service shall also
delete the respective Session resource.
```
â¢ The close ( 0x8 ) is received over the connection. The service shall also set the ConnectionEnabled property in
```
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 173
the OutboundConnection resource to false and delete the respective Session resource.

13 Security details
```
13.1 Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
```
```
13.1.1 Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol overview
```
```
Implementations shall support the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol v1.2 with RFC7525 recommendations or
```
later. Implementations may remove support for older versions for TLS in favor of newer versions.
```
DEPRECATED: Previous versions of this specification allowed for TLS v1.1.
```
Implementations should support:
```
â¢ The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) TLS Specification for Storage Systems.
```
â¢ The latest version of the TLS v1.x specification.
13.1.2 Cipher suites
Implementations shall only support cipher suites listed as "Recommended" in the TLS Cipher Suites table defined
by the IANA TLS Parameters registry.
Cipher suites that are listed as mandatory in various RFCs, but are not "Recommended" in the TLS Cipher Suites
table defined by the IANA TLS Parameters registry, shall not be supported.
Implementations should consider the support of pre-shared key ciphers suites listed as "Recommended" in the TLS
Cipher Suites table defined by the IANA TLS Parameters registry, which enable authentication and identification
without trusted certificates.
DEPRECATED
Implementations should support AES-256-based ciphers from the TLS suites.
Redfish implementations should consider the support of ciphers, such as the following ciphers, which enable
authentication and identification without trusted certificates:
TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 175
The advantage of these recommended ciphers is:
AES-GCM is not only efficient and secure, but hardware implementations can achieve high speeds with low cost
and low latency because the mode can be pipelined.
Additionally, Redfish implementations should support the following cipher:
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
For more information, see RFC5487 and RFC5288.
END DEPRECATED
13.1.3 Certificates
Redfish implementations shall support replacement of the default certificate if one is provided.
Redfish implementations shall use certificates that conform to X.509-v3, as defined in RFC5280.
13.2 Sensitive data
Operations that contain sensitive data should use HTTPS only. For example, a SimpleUpdate action with a
username and password should use HTTPS to protect the sensitive data.
Properties in service responses that represent sensitive data, such as passwords, shall be null .
Responses from URIs where the URI itself contains sensitive data in a URI segment may return the HTTP 404 Not
Found status code instead of the HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code, the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code, or the
HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed status code to prevent attackers from obtaining the sensitive data in the URI.
13.3 Authentication
13.3.1 Authentication overview
```
Services:
```
â¢ Shall support both HTTP Basic authentication and Redfish session login authentication.
â¢ Shall use only connections that conform to TLS to transport the data between any third-party authentication
service and clients.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
176 Published Version 1.23.0
â¢ Shall not require a client that uses HTTP Basic authentication to create a session.
â¢ May implement other authentication mechanisms.
13.3.2 Authentication requirements
13.3.2.1 Resource and operation authentication requirements
Services shall authenticate all write requests to Redfish resources. For example:
â¢ POST , except to the Sessions resource collection for authentication
â¢ PUT
â¢ PATCH
â¢ DELETE
Redfish resources shall not be available as unauthenticated, except for:
â¢ The service root to identify the device and service locations.
â¢ The Redfish metadata document to get resource types.
â¢ The OData service document for compatibility with OData clients.
â¢ The Redfish OpenAPI YAML document for compatibility with OpenAPI clients.
â¢ The version object at /redfish .
Services may reject requests to the previous resources if invalid credentials are provided by the client.
```
Note: This specification does not cover external services that are linked through external references. These
```
services may have other security requirements.
13.3.2.2 HTTP header authentication requirements
An authentication header shall accompany every request that establishes a secure channel.
```
Services:
```
â¢ Shall process HTTP headers for authentication before other headers that may affect the response. For example,
ETag , If-Match , and so on.
â¢ Shall not use HTTP cookies to authenticate any activity, such as GET , POST , PUT , PATCH , and DELETE .
13.3.2.3 Authentication failure requirements
When authentication fails, extended error messages shall not provide privileged information.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 177
13.3.3 HTTP Basic authentication
Services shall support HTTP Basic authentication, as defined by RFC7617, and shall use only connections that
conform to TLS to transport the data between any third-party authentication service and clients.
All requests that use HTTP Basic authentication shall require HTTPS.
When multi-factor authentication is enabled, services shall reject HTTP Basic authentication for accounts that are not
configured to bypass multi-factor authentication. Session-based authentication is required in this case.
```
Note: The IETF has highlighted security concerns with HTTP Basic authentication. While HTTPS is required for
```
the usage of HTTP Basic authentication, there are other concerns implementers need to be aware of that
RFC7617 documents. This functionality can be restricted or disabled with the HTTPBasicAuth property in the
AccountService resource.
13.3.4 Redfish session login authentication
Service shall provide login sessions that conform with this specification.
Session management is determined by the implementation of the Redfish service, which includes orphaned session
timeout and the management of the number of simultaneous open sessions.
13.3.4.1 Redfish login sessions
For improved performance and security, a client should use the session management interface to create a Redfish
login session. The session service specifies the URI for session management.
To establish a session, find the URI in either:
â¢ The session service's Sessions property.
â¢ The service root's links property under the Sessions property.
Both URIs shall be the same.
```
{
```
```
"SessionService": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService"
```
},
```
```
"Links": {
```
```
"Sessions": {
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions"
```
}
```
```
},
```
Redfish Specification DSP0266
178 Published Version 1.23.0
...
```
}
```
13.3.4.2 Session login
To create a Redfish session without an authentication header, perform an HTTP POST request on the session
service's Sessions resource collection. The POST to create a session shall only be supported with HTTPS. If both
HTTP and HTTPS are enabled, a POST request to create a session through the HTTP port should redirect to the
HTTPS port. Include the following POST body:
POST /redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions HTTP/1.1
```
Host: <host-path>
```
```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
Content-Length: <computed-length>
```
Accept: application/json;charset=utf-8
```
OData-Version: 4.0
```
{
```
"UserName": "<username>",
"Password": "<password>"
```
}
```
Fields in brackets are placeholders for client-specific values.
When a multi-factor authentication type that requires tokens is enabled, services shall require the Token property in
the POST request to the SessionCollection resource for accounts that are not configured to bypass multi-factor
authentication unless Time-based One-Time Password multi-factor authentication is enabled and the user account
does not have a secret key configured. Additional semantics for this condition are described in the Time-based One-
Time Password secret key handling clause. The service shall verify the provided token in addition to verifying the
username and password. If the Token property is required and not provided by the client, but the client provided a
valid UserName and Password combination, the service shall return the HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code and an
error response with the AuthenticationTokenRequired message from the Base Message Registry. In addition, if the
multi-factor authentication type uses a service-generated one-time passcode, the service shall also return the
OneTimePasscodeSent message from the Base Message Registry, and send a one-time passcode to the configured
delivery address for that account.
To verify that the request has been initiated from an authorized client domain, services should save the Origin
header in reference to this session creation and compare it to subsequent requests using this session.
The response to the POST request to create a session shall include:
â¢ X-Auth-Token header. Contains a session authentication token that the client can use in subsequent requests.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 179
â¢ Location header. Contains a hyperlink to the new Session resource.
â¢ JSON response body. Contains the full representation of the new Session resource.
The following sample response shows a newly created session:
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
Location: /redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/1
```
X-Auth-Token: <session-auth-token>
```
{
```
"@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/1",
"@odata.type": "#Session.v1_0_0.Session",
"Id": "1",
"Name": "User Session",
"Description": "User Session",
"UserName": "<username>",
"Password": null
```
}
```
The client that sends the session login request should save the session authentication token from the X-Auth-Token
header and the contents of the Location header from the response of the login POST request.
To authenticate subsequent requests, the client sets the X-Auth-Token header to the session authentication token
that the POST login request returns.
```
Note: The session ID differs from the session authentication token, as follows:
```
â¢ Session ID: The session ID uniquely identifies the Session resource. The response data with the last
segment of the Location header URI returns is the session ID. To view active sessions and terminate any
session, an administrator with sufficient privileges can use the session ID.
â¢ Session authentication token: Only the client that executes the login has the session authentication
token.
13.3.4.3 Session lifetime
Unlike some token-based methods that use token expiration times, Redfish sessions time out. As long as a client
continues to send requests more frequently than the session timeout period, the session remains open and the
session authentication token remains valid. If the session times out, it is automatically terminated.
13.3.4.4 Session termination or logout
When the client logs out, the Redfish session terminates. The session terminates through a DELETE request to the
Session resource defined in either the Location header URI or the session ID in the response data.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
180 Published Version 1.23.0
This ability to DELETE a session through the Session resource enables an administrator with sufficient privileges to
terminate other users' sessions from a different session.
When a session is terminated, the service shall not affect independent connections established originally by this
session for other purposes, such as connections for server-sent events or transferring an image for the update
service.
13.3.5 Client certificate authentication
If client certificate authentication is enabled, the service shall send a client certificate request during the Transport
```
Layer Security (TLS) handshake. When the service obtains a client certificate during the TLS handshake, the service
```
shall verify the certificate with the certificates in CertificateCollection resource referenced by the
ClientCertificate property within the MFA property of the AccountService resource. The service shall check for
```
certificate revocation before processing the request with any configured Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
```
servers.
The RespondToUnauthenticatedClients property within the ClientCertificate property within the MFA property of
the AccountService resource controls the response behavior when an invalid certificate is provided by the client.
â¢ If the property contains true or is not supported by the service, the service shall not fail the TLS handshake.
This is to allow the service to send error messages or unauthenticated resources to the client.
â¢ If the property contains false , the service shall fail the TLS handshake.
13.4 Authorization
13.4.1 Authorization overview
The Redfish authorization subsystem controls which users have access to resources and the type of access that
users have. It consists of two parts: the privilege model and the operation-to-privilege mapping.
The privilege model maps users to roles and maps roles to privileges. A privilege is a permission to complete an
operation, such as read or write, within a defined management domain. For example, the ConfigureUsers privilege
allows adding a user. A user is authorized to access a resource if they have the privileges required for that resource.
The operation-to-privilege mapping defines which privileges are required to access any given operation.
Redfish allows vendors to extend the standard privilege model with OEM privileges and custom OEM roles. OEM
privileges and custom roles participate in the privilege model the same as Redfish standard privileges and roles.
Services may also allow clients to create custom roles. Restricted roles and restricted privileges allow vendors to
further refine their authority model.
Services shall enforce the same privilege model for ETag-related activity as is enforced for the data being
represented by the ETag. For example, the privilege required to read an ETag shall be the same as the privilege to
read the data item that the ETag represents.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 181
13.4.2 Privilege model
Each user shall be assigned exactly one role with the RoleId property in the ManagerAccount resource. The value of
the RoleId property identifies a Role resource in the RoleCollection resource, where a role defines a set of
privileges. A role shall be assigned to a user when a manager account is created. The client shall provide the
RoleId property when creating a manager account to select one of the standard or custom roles.
Services shall provide information about all roles through the RoleCollection resource. The AssignedPrivileges
and OemPrivileges arrays in the Role resource define a set of assigned privileges for the associated role. Two roles
with the same privileges shall behave equivalently.
13.4.2.1 Roles
Redfish defines a set of standard roles, allows a service to define custom OEM roles, and allows client-defined
custom roles.
A service shall support all of the standard roles in Table 41. The value of the Id and AssignedPrivileges properties
in the Role resource for the standard roles shall contain the Role name and Assigned privileges column values,
respectively. The AssignedPrivileges property for standard roles shall not be modifiable. The IsPredefined
property for standard roles shall contain the value true .
Table 41 describes the standard roles:
Table 41 â Required standard roles
Role name Assigned privileges
Administrator Login , ConfigureManager , ConfigureUsers , ConfigureComponents , ConfigureSelf
Operator Login , ConfigureComponents , ConfigureSelf
ReadOnly Login , ConfigureSelf
A service may support one or more of the standard roles in Table 42. The value of the Id and AssignedPrivileges
properties in the Role resource for the standard roles shall contain the Role name and Assigned privileges
column values, respectively. The AssignedPrivileges property for standard roles shall not be modifiable. The
IsPredefined property for standard roles shall contain the value true .
Table 42 describes the optional standard roles:
Redfish Specification DSP0266
182 Published Version 1.23.0
Table 42 â Optional standard roles
Role name Assigned privileges Description
SystemAdministrator Login , ConfigureSelf ,AdministrateSystemsAdministrator for systems found in the systems collection. Able to manageboot configuration, keys, and certificates for systems.
SystemOperator Login , ConfigureSelf ,OperateSystemsOperator for systems found in the systems collection. Able to performresets and configure interfaces.
StorageAdministrator Login , ConfigureSelf ,AdministrateStorageAdministrator for storage subsystems and storage systems found in thestorage collection and storage system collection respectively.
StorageBackupOperator Login , ConfigureSelf ,OperateStorageBackup
Operator for storage backup functionality for storage subsystems and
storage systems found in the storage collection and storage system
collection respectively.
A service may define custom OEM roles. The IsPredefined property for OEM roles shall contain the value true . A
service shall not allow users to modify predefined OEM roles. OEM role names should begin with a lowercase
character or "Oem" followed by a vendor name to avoid conflict with future Redfish predefined role names.
A service may allow custom client-defined roles to be created, modified, and deleted. If allowed, a user can perform a
POST request on the RoleCollection resource to create a role, indicating privileges in the AssignedPrivileges and
OemPrivileges properties in the Role resource. A service may restrict which privileges are allowed. The
IsPredefined property for client-defined roles shall contain the value false . A service shall not allow a client-
defined role to be deleted while it is in use, for example, when it is assigned to a local user or an LDAP
RemoteRoleMapping property.
The value of the RoleId property shall be unique across all roles within the RoleCollection resource.
Non-Redfish services, such as those enabled by the AccountTypes property within the ManagerAccount resource,
should map the Redfish RoleId to their permission system. For example, an SSH user with Administrator as the
value of the RoleId property could map to "root" for the SSH service. However, the privileges specified by the
AssignedPrivileges and OemPrivileges do not necessarily map to non-Redfish services.
13.4.2.2 Restricted roles and restricted privileges
Restricted roles and restricted privileges are intended to prevent privilege escalation. Restricted roles and restricted
privileges are not less functional, but their usage is restricted to particular users. For example, to have a security
administrator have privileges that the administrator does not have, you need to ensure the administrator cannot
escalate to the security administrator role. An implementation can help achieve this by restricting the Administrator
role and providing an alternate administrator role that lacks the security privilege.
A service may restrict any role. The Restricted property for restricted roles shall contain the value true . When a
standard role is restricted, services shall provide the AlternateRoleId property to reference a non-restricted custom
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 183
role intended for clients to use as an alternate. Services may pre-define or create accounts that are configured with a
restricted role.
Services shall not allow:
â¢ A RoleId value for a restricted role to be specified when creating or modifying a ManagerAccount resource. This
ensures administrators cannot create an account for themselves that has a restricted role.
â¢ Modification of ManagerAccount resources with a RoleId property containing a value for a restricted role, with
the exception of the Enabled property. This ensures administrators cannot gain access to another account.
â¢ Deletion of ManagerAccount resources with a RoleId property containing a value for a restricted role.
â¢ A restricted role to be specified in the LocalRole property within the RemoteRoleMapping property within the
AccountService and ExternalAccountProvider resources.
A service may restrict any privilege, including standard and OEM privileges. The RestrictedPrivileges and
RestrictedOemPrivileges properties in the AccountService resource shall specify the restricted privileges. Services
shall not allow custom roles to specify restricted privileges. Services may contain predefined roles that are configured
with restricted privileges.
13.4.2.3 OEM privileges
OEM privileges allow a service to extend the privilege model by adding additional privileges to have additional control
of what operations are allowed. It can be used when a standard privilege is overly broad.
A service may define OEM privileges and may include OEM privileges in any predefined role, including standard and
custom OEM roles. The OemPrivileges property within the Role resource shall contain the OEM privileges that are
assigned to the role. The OemPrivileges property in the Role resource for the predefined roles shall not be
modifiable.
A service may allow OEM privileges to be assigned to client-defined roles.
13.4.3 Redfish service operation-to-privilege mapping
For every request that a client makes to a service, the service shall determine that the authenticated identity of the
requester has the authorization to complete the requested operation on the resource in the request.
Using the role and privileges authorization model where an authenticated identity context is assigned a role and a
role is a set of privileges, the service typically checks an HTTP request against a mapping of the authenticated
requesting identity role and privileges to determine whether the identity privileges are sufficient to complete the
operation in the request.
A service may perform additional checks based on the identity of the user and remove data from responses. For
example, a service might restrict access for non-administrative users to only access their own ManagerAccount ,
Session , and EventDestination resources.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
184 Published Version 1.23.0
13.4.3.1 Why specify operation-to-privilege mapping?
Initial versions of the Redfish Specifications defined several role-to-privilege mappings for standardized roles and
normatively identified several privilege labels but did not normatively detail what these privileges or how privilege-to-
operations mappings could be specified or represented in a normative fashion.
The lack of a methodology to define which privileges are required to complete a requested operation against the URI
in the request puts at risk the interoperability between service implementations that clients may encounter due to
variances in privilege requirements between implementations.
Also, a lack of methodology for specifying and representing the operation-to-privilege mapping prevents the Redfish
Forum or other governing organizations from normatively defining privilege requirements for a service.
13.4.3.2 Representing operation-to-privilege mappings
A service should provide a Privilege Registry in the registry collection. This registry represents the privileges required
to complete HTTP operations against resources supported by the service.
The Privilege Registry is a JSON document that contains a Mappings array of where an individual entry exists for
every resource type that the service supports.
The operation-to-privilege mapping is defined for every resource type and applies to every resource the service
implements for the applicable resource type.
In several situations, specific resources or properties may have differing operation-to-privilege mappings than the
resource type-level mappings. In these cases, the resource type-level mappings need to be overridden. The
PrivilegeRegistry schema defines the methodology for resource type-level operation-to-privilege mappings and
related overrides.
If a service provides a Privilege Registry, the service shall use the Redfish Forum's Privilege Registry definition as a
base operation-to-privilege mapping definition for operations that the service supports to promote interoperability for
Redfish clients.
13.4.3.3 Operation map syntax
An operation map defines the set of privileges required to complete an operation on a resource-type.
The mapped operations are GET , PUT , PATCH , POST , DELETE , and HEAD . A privilege mapping is defined for each
operation, irrespective of whether the service or data model supports the operation on the resource-type.
The privilege labels may be the Redfish standardized labels that the PrivilegeType enumeration in the Privileges
schema defines and they may be OEM-defined privilege labels. The required privileges for an operation are specified
using logical AND and OR behavior. For more information, see the Privilege AND and OR syntax clause.
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 185
The following example defines the privileges required for various operations on the Manager resource. Unless the
implementation defines mapping overrides to the OperationMap array, the specified operation-to-privilege mapping
represents behavior for all Manager resources in a service implementation.
```
{
```
"Entity": "Manager",
```
"OperationMap": {
```
```
"GET": [{
```
"Privilege": ["Login"]
```
}],
```
```
"HEAD": [{
```
"Privilege": ["Login"]
```
}],
```
```
"PATCH": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureManager"]
```
}],
```
```
"POST": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureManager"]
```
}],
```
```
"PUT": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureManager"]
```
}],
```
```
"DELETE": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureManager"]
```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}
```
13.4.3.4 Mapping overrides syntax
Table 43 describes the operation-to-privilege mapping, which varies from the resource type-level mapping:
Table 43 â Mapping overrides syntax
Situation Description
Property override
Property has different privilege requirements than the resource in which it resides. For example, the
Password property in the ManagerAccount resource requires the ConfigureSelf or ConfigureUsers
privilege to change, in contrast to the ConfigureUsers privilege required for the other properties in
ManagerAccount resources. If multiple properties with the same name are present in a resource, the
property override applies to all property instances.
Subordinate override
Resource is used in context of another resource and the contextual privileges need to govern. For
example, the privileges for PATCH operations on EthernetInterface resources depend on whether
the resource is subordinate to the Manager resource, where ConfigureManager is required, or the
ComputerSystem resource, where ConfigureComponents is required.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
186 Published Version 1.23.0
Situation Description
Resource URI override Resource instance has different privilege requirements for an operation than those defined for theresource type.
The overrides are defined in the context of the operation-to-privilege mapping for a resource type.
If multiple overrides are specified for a single resource type, the following precedence should be used for determining
the appropriate override to apply:
â¢ Property override
â¢ Resource URI override
â¢ Subordinate override
13.4.3.5 Property override example
In the following example, the Password property on the ManagerAccount resource requires the ConfigureSelf or
ConfigureUsers privilege to change, in contrast to the ConfigureUsers privilege required for the other properties in
ManagerAccount resources:
```
{
```
"Entity": "ManagerAccount",
```
"OperationMap": {
```
```
"GET": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureManager"]
```
}, {
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureUsers"]
```
}, {
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureSelf"]
```
}],
```
```
"HEAD": [{
```
"Privilege": ["Login"]
```
}],
```
```
"PATCH": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureUsers"]
```
}],
```
```
"POST": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureUsers"]
```
}],
```
```
"PUT": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureUsers"]
```
}],
```
```
"DELETE": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureUsers"]
```
}]
```
```
},
```

```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}]
```
```
}
```
13.4.3.6 Subordinate override
The Targets property in SubordinateOverrides lists a hierarchical representation for when to apply the override. In
the following example, the override for an EthernetInterface resource is applied when it is subordinate to an
EthernetInterfaceCollection resource, which in turn is subordinate to a Manager resource. If a client were to
PATCH an EthernetInterface resource that matches this override condition, it requires the ConfigureManager
privilege. Otherwise, the client requires the ConfigureComponents privilege.
```

```
"Entity": "EthernetInterface",
```
"OperationMap": {
```
```
"GET": [{
```
"Privilege": ["Login"]
```
}],

}]
```
```
}
```
```
}]
```
```
}
```
13.4.3.7 Resource URI override
The following example demonstrates the resource URI override syntax to define operation privilege variations for
resource URIs.
The example defines both ConfigureComponents and OEMAdminPriv privileges as required to make a PATCH
operation on the two resource URIs listed as targets.
```
{
```
"Entity": "ComputerSystem",
```
"OperationMap": {
```
```
"GET": [{
```
"Privilege": ["Login"]
```
}],
```
```
"HEAD": [{

}],
```
```
"PUT": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureComponents"]

}],
```
```
"PATCH": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureComponents", "OEMSysAdminPriv"]
```
}]
```
```
}
```
```
}]
```
```
}
```
13.4.3.8 Privilege AND and OR syntax
The array placement of the privilege labels in the OperationMap GET , HEAD , PATCH , POST , PUT , and DELETE
operation element arrays define the logical combinations of privileges that are required to call an operation on a
resource or property.
For OR logical combinations, the privilege label appears in the operation element array as individual elements.
The following example defines either Login or OEMPrivilege1 privileges that are required to perform a GET request.
```
{
```
```
"GET": [{
```
"Privilege": ["Login"]
```
}, {
```
"Privilege": ["OEMPrivilege1"]
```
}]
```
```
}
```
For logical AND combinations, the privilege label appears in the Privilege property array in the operation element.
The following example defines both ConfigureComponents and OEMSysAdminPriv that are required to perform a
PATCH request.
```
{
```
```
"PATCH": [{
```
"Privilege": ["ConfigureComponents", "OEMSysAdminPriv"]
```
}]
```
```
}
```

13.4.4 Delegated authorization with OAuth 2.0
Services may support the RFC6749-defined OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.
13.4.4.1 OAuth 2.0 overview
The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework allows a client to obtain access to a resource server from a resource owner
and an authorization server.
Clients request access from a resource owner and is given an authorization grant. The authorization grant is then
provided to the authorization server and an access token is provided to the client. The client provides the access
token to the resource server in order to access a protected resource.
A Redfish service is considered to be a resource server in the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.
13.4.4.2 OAuth 2.0 data model requirements
Services that support OAuth 2.0:
â¢ Shall support the OAuth2 property in the AccountService resource.
â¢ May support additional OAuth 2.0 servers with ExternalAccountProvider resources.
13.4.4.3 OAuth 2.0 access tokens
Access tokens are the credentials the client provides to a service to access a protected resource. Clients provide the
access token to the service in the Authorization request header as a bearer token.
```
Services that support OAuth 2.0 shall support receiving an RFC7519-defined JSON Web Token (JWT) in the
```
Authorization request header.
JWTs are a compressed JSON structure that contain a JOSE Header, a set of claims that describe the type of
access that is granted to a client, and a signature. Each component of a JWT is Base64URL-encoded and
concatenated with a . to form the token string for the Authorization header.
Table 44 describes the JWT JOSE Header parameters and their requirements for services and clients. Any other
parameters are outside the scope of this specification.
Services shall process the parameters in Table 44 if the Service requirement column contains Yes. Services should
process other parameters.
The JWT provided by the client shall contain the parameters in Table 44 if the JWT requirement column contains
Yes. The JWT provided by the client may omit other parameters.

Authorization request header.
13.4.4.4 Redfish OAuth2.0 scope usage
The value of the scope claim is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings. Each value in the list
describes a type of access that was granted to the client.
This specification defines two formats for values in the scope claim: Redfish roles and Redfish privileges. Other
formats are outside the scope of this specification.
Redfish roles within the scope claim shall be in the form Redfish.Role.<RoleId> where <RoleId> is the identifier of
the Redfish role granted to the client.
Redfish privileges within the scope claim shall be in the form Redfish.Privilege.<PrivilegeId> where
<PrivilegeId> is the standard privilege or OEM privilege granted to the client.
Services shall ignore unsupported values in the scope claim. If the token provided by the client is valid, the service
shall apply roles and privileges in the scope claim to the operation.

13.5 Account service
13.5.1 Account service overview
â¢ Implementations should store user passwords with one-way encryption techniques.
â¢ Implementations may support exporting user accounts with passwords, but shall do so using encryption methods
to protect them.
â¢ User accounts shall support ETags and atomic operations. Implementations may reject requests that do not
include an ETag.
â¢ When authentication fails, extended error messages shall not provide privileged information.
13.5.2 Password management
A Redfish service provides local user accounts through a collection of ManagerAccount resources located under the
account service. The ManagerAccount resources enable users to manage their own account information, and for
administrators to create, delete, and manage other user accounts.
When account properties are changed, the service may close open sessions for this account and require re-
authentication.
13.5.3 Atomic password changes
If the RequireChangePasswordAction property in the AccountService resource contains true , services shall reject
modifications to the Password property in ManagerAccount resources in PATCH or PUT operations. Clients are
required to invoke the ChangePassword action in the ManagerAccount resource to update the password for a user
account.
This functionality can be used to protect the service from session hijacking. The SessionAccountPassword parameter
in the ChangePassword action allows the service to verify the client's credentials before changing the password of the
account. If a user is changing their own password, the SessionAccountPassword parameter shall contain the current
password of the account. If an administrator is performing the password change for a different user, the
SessionAccountPassword parameter shall contain the administrator's password.
If the client is performing requests with HTTP Basic authentication, the SessionAccountPassword contains the same
password encoded in the Authorization request header.
13.5.4 Password change required handling
The service may require that passwords assigned by the manufacturer be changed by the end user prior to
Redfish Specification DSP0266
194 Published Version 1.23.0
accessing the service. In addition, administrators may require users to change their account's password upon first
access.
The ManagerAccount resource contains a PasswordChangeRequired boolean property to enable this functionality.
Resources that have the property set to true shall require the user to change the write-only Password property in
that resource before access is granted. Manufacturers including user credentials for the service may use this method
to force a change to those credentials before access is granted.
When a client accesses the service by using credentials from a ManagerAccount resource that has a
PasswordChangeRequired value of true , the service shall allow:
â¢ A session login and include the @Message.ExtendedInfo annotation in the response containing the
PasswordChangeRequired message from the Base Message Registry. This indicates to the client that their
session is restricted to performing only the password change operation before access is granted.
â¢ A GET operation on the ManagerAccount resource associated with the account.
â¢ A PATCH operation on the ManagerAccount resource associated with the account to update the Password
property if the RequireChangePasswordAction in the AccountService resource contains false or is not present.
If the value of Password is changed, the service shall also set the PasswordChangeRequired property to false .
â¢ A POST operation on the ChangePassword action on the ManagerAccount resource associated with the account
to update the Password property. If the value of Password is changed, the service shall also set the
PasswordChangeRequired property to false .
â¢ A DELETE operation on Session resources representing open sessions associated with the account.
When a client accesses the service by using credentials from a ManagerAccount resource that has a
PasswordChangeRequired value of true , the service may allow GET operations on unauthenticated resources, such
as the ServiceRoot resource.
For all other operations, the service shall respond with the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code and an error response
with the PasswordChangeRequired message from the Base Message Registry.
13.5.5 Time-based One-Time Password secret key handling
```
When RFC6238-defined Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) multi-factor authentication is enabled, the user
```
account is not configured to bypass Time-based One-Time Password multi-factor authentication, and the user
account does not contain a secret key for Time-based One-Time Password multi-factor authentication, the service:
â¢ Shall allow a session login without the Token property and include the @Message.ExtendedInfo annotation in the
response containing the GenerateSecretKeyRequired message from the Base Message Registry. This indicates
to the client that their session is restricted to performing only the GenerateSecretKey action on their
ManagerAccount resource before access is granted.
â¢ Shall allow a POST operation on the GenerateSecretKey action on the ManagerAccount resource associated with
the account to generate a Time-based One-Time Password secret key.
â¦ Clients shall retain the value of the secret key in the response to generate tokens for future session creation
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 195
requests.
â¢ Shall allow a POST operation on the VerifyTimeBasedOneTimePassword action on the ManagerAccount resource
associated with the account, if the action is supported by the service. This allows a client to verify they are able
to produce valid tokens with their secret key prior to closing the session.
â¢ Shall allow a DELETE operation on Session resources representing open sessions associated with the account.
â¢ May allow GET operations on unauthenticated resources, such as the ServiceRoot resource.
For all other operations, the service shall respond with the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code and an error response
with the GenerateSecretKeyRequired message from the Base Message Registry.
When the secret key is generated for the user with the GenerateSecretKey action on the ManagerAccount resource
associated with the account, the service shall require the client to create a new session with the Token property to
perform other operations.
13.6 Asynchronous tasks
Irrespective of which user or privileged context starts a task, services shall enforce the privileges described in the
privilege registry required to perform operations on the Task resource.
13.7 Event subscriptions
Before pushing event data object to the destination, the service may verify the destination for identity purposes.
Services shall not send events to clients that do not have sufficient privilege to access the resource originating the
event. For push-style eventing, this is determined by the client that performed an HTTP POST to the subscription
collection. For server-sent events, this is determined by the client that opened the SSE connection.

15 Redfish composability
A service may implement the CompositionService resource off of ServiceRoot to bind resources. One example is
disaggregated hardware, which allows for independent components, such as processors, memory, I/O controllers,
and drives, to be bound to create logical constructs that operate together. This enables a client to dynamically assign
resources for an application.
A service that supports composability shall implement resource blocks, defined by the ResourceBlock schema, and
resource zones, defined in the Zone schema, for the composition service. Resource blocks provide an inventory of
components available to the client for building compositions. Resource zones describe the binding restrictions of the
resource blocks that the service manages.
The resource zones within the composition service shall include the collection capabilities annotation in responses.
The collection capabilities annotation allows a client to discover which resource collections in the service support
compositions, the different composition request types allowed, how the POST request for the resource collection is
formatted, and which properties are required.
A service that supports composability and client multi-tenancy shall:
â¢ Implement the FreePool and ActivePool properties in the CompositionService resource.
â¢ Implement the CompositionReservations property in the CompositionService resource.
â¢ Filter GET requests for the ResourceBlocks , FreePool , ActivePool , ResourceZones , and
CompositionReservations resource collections where the value of the Client property in the ResourceBlock
resource or CompositionReservation resource matches the client identity.
â¢ Ensure the resources in composition requests are assigned to the client specified by the Client property in the
ResourceBlock resource or CompositionReservation resource.
â¢ Not filter any HTTP operations within the composition service for clients that contain the privilege
ConfigureCompositionInfrastructure unless specified by query parameters.
â¢ Move resource blocks between the FreePool and ActivePool resource collections based on the outcome of
composition requests.
â¦ A resource block is moved to the FreePool resource collection when it is not contributing to any composed
resources.
â¦ A resource block is moved to the ActivePool resource collection when it is contributing to one or more
composed resources.

15.1 Composition requests
15.1.1 Composition requests overview
A service that implements the composition service, as defined by the CompositionService schema, shall support one
or more of the following types of composition requests:
â¢ Specific composition
â¢ Constrained composition
â¢ Expandable resources
A service that supports the removal of a composed resource shall support the DELETE method on the composed
resource.
A service may implement the Compose action in the CompositionService resource for the above composition
requests.
15.1.2 Specific composition
A specific composition is when a client identifies an exact set of resources in which to build a logical entity.
A service that supports specific compositions shall support a POST request that contains an array of hyperlinks to
resource blocks. The schema for the resource being composed defines where the resource blocks are specified in
the request.
The following example shows a ComputerSystem being composed with a specific composition request:
POST /redfish/v1/Systems HTTP/1.1
```

15.1.3 Constrained composition
A constrained composition is when a client has identified a set of criteria, or constraints, in which to build a logical
entity. This includes criteria such as quantities of components, or characteristics of components. A service that
supports constrained compositions shall support a POST request that contains the set of characteristics to apply to
the composed resource. The specific format of the request is defined by the schema for the resource being
composed. This type of request may include expanded elements of resources subordinate to the composed
resource.
The following constrained composition request composes a ComputerSystem :

15.1.4 Expandable resources
An expandable resource is when a service has a baseline composition that cannot be removed. Instead of a client
making requests to create a composed resource, a client can only add or remove resources from the composed
resource. A service that supports expandable resources shall support one or more of the update methods that the
Updating a composed resource clause describes.
15.2 Updating a composed resource
A service that supports updating a composed resource shall provide one or more of the following methods to update
composed resources:
â¢ The PUT or PATCH methods on the composed resource with a modified list of resource blocks.
â¢ Actions on the composed resource for adding and removing resource blocks.
â¦ If the actions for adding and removing resource blocks are present in the resource, clients should use this
method before attempting PUT or PATCH .
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 201
16 Aggregation
Aggregation has been a Redfish concept since its inception. Redfish uses collection for services that can represent
more than one system. As the scale of Redfish implementations increase, clients want to operate on Redfish
resources in bulk.
Aggregation is the representation of Redfish resources from a variety of sources so that they can be managed, in
whole or in part, by a Redfish client. Membership can be heterogeneous and arbitrary, but it is expected that most
aggregate members are the same resource type, such as an aggregate of ComputerSystem resource, which is
represented by an Aggregate resource where members of its Elements array are exclusively of type
ComputerSystem . The Redfish service proxies on behalf of the aggregated components to provide common
operations. The Redfish service is representing resources on behalf of the components and incoming operations
must be tracked by the Redfish service before being accomplished by communicating with the individual resources.
Thus, aggregation also allows a Redfish client to act on resources as a group using aggregates.
16.1 Classes of aggregators
16.1.1 Implicit and complex aggregators
There are at least two classes of Redfish aggregators:
â¢ Implicit aggregators. An example of an implicit aggregator is an enclosure manager, such as a manager of
blades in an enclosure. This implementation has ComputerSystem resources representing blades in the
ComputerSystemCollection resource, and one or more Manager resources in the ManagerCollection resource. It
also would likely have a Chassis resource for each blade and a Chassis resource for the enclosure, which
would use the Contains property in Links to express the containment relationship to the individual blades. This
class of aggregator has tight coupling with system design and proxies requests to and from the blades to
perform management functions.
â¢ Complex aggregators. An example of a complex aggregator is a rack-level manager, fabric manager, or a
manager of similar scale, especially if it represents resources that it gathers through the proxy of information
from other managers, like BMCs. The sources that this manager aggregates are more complex in nature and
potentially varying. This manager probably has an interface to the resources and proxies the Redfish service on
behalf of each set of resources. At this scale, a Redfish client would prefer to provide common functions, such
as resetting a set of systems, to the Redfish service as a whole rather than invoking actions individually to
achieve scalability requirements. This class of service also may need assistance in adding members to the
service, such as providing address and account information for the aggregator to contact the components and
initiate the proxy of Redfish operations.
Redfish Specification DSP0266
202 Published Version 1.23.0
16.1.2 Use cases
Several use cases make explicit aggregator representation necessary. What they have in common is the need for
common functions for scalability. There are several classes of these common functions.
One use case is service-type functions. An example is a firmware update on a large number of systems. Rather than
invoke actions on individual resources, it is more efficient for a client to specify to which resources to apply the
image. In this case, a service already exists in the model so an aggregation service is not needed. Instead, the
existing service must be augmented to enable the application of an image to a list of resources.
Another use case is common actions. Examples are the Reset or SetDefaultBootOrder actions. These actions are
defined in the ComputerSystem schema, but the Redfish URI structure requires that the action occur on each
ComputerSystem resource. Thus, an individual operation applies to each resource. It is more efficient for a client to
send one action with the list of the resources to which to apply the action. For example, to reset one thousand
systems, sending one thousand individual reset operations requires significant overhead as compared to sending a
single operation with a list of one thousand systems to reset.
A final use case is changing an attribute on multiple members of a collection. An example is changing the boot order
on a large number of systems. This use case requires one operation per system. However, assuming the resources
are in the same collection, the deep PATCH operation meets the requirements of this use case.
16.2 Aggregation service
16.2.1 Aggregation service overview
The AggregationService resource represents the Redfish aggregation service, which provides aggregation
functions.
The aggregation service contains the group actions that can apply to groups of resources. The AggregationService
schema defines the common actions that a client can take on groups of resources. These actions take an array of
resource URIs as one of the parameters to which the action applies. If all members of the resource array do not
support the method, a 4xx status code shall be returned and the body shall contain an error response. If at least
one member of the resource array successfully completed the action but others did not, the status code should be
200 OK with @Message.ExtendedInfo objects for the failed members.
The aggregation service also contains Aggregate , AggregationSource , and ConnectionMethod resources.
16.2.2 Aggregator requirements
By implementing the AggregationService resource and including an AggregationSourceCollection resource, a
complex aggregator shall meet the following requirements:
DSP0266 Redfish Specification
Version 1.23.0 Published 203
â¢ Proxy to the aggregated resources on behalf of the service.
â¢ Provide error and state propagation, such as health roll-up, when needed to provide such data to the parent
resource.
â¢ Combine resource collections from the aggregated resources.
â¦ For example, ComputerSystem resources that were gathered through proxy shall be in one
ComputerSystemCollection resource.
â¦ Services shall complete a URI fix-up for all aggregated resources because every system cannot be at
/redfish/v1/Systems/1 .
â¦ It is advisable for Redfish implementations to use unique values for the Id properties. For example, base
the Id property of a ComputerSystem resource on something unique like a UUID or serial number, or the
manufacturer MAC address for network adapters, or WWN for Fibre Channel controllers.
â¢ Unify other services.
â¦ The aggregation implementation hosts only one event service. The implementation shall combine all events
into one stream. The implementation also hosts only one sessions service, telemetry service, update
service, and other services. Thus the aggregator represents unification of Redfish services with which it
communicates and proxies on the client's behalf to the providers of those services and information.
16.2.3 Aggregates
The Aggregate resource is the grouping mechanism that clients use to indicate to the service that this group of
resources can be treated the same for certain functions, such as the actions. Each aggregate contains the list of
individual resources that are to be treated as a single unit for operations. For example, if a client wishes to express
that a subset of the ComputerSystemCollection resource be treated as a single unit for certain operations like reset,
reset boot order, or firmware update, it can express the aggregate as the target URI for the operation.
The Aggregate schema defines the common actions that a client can make on an aggregate. The Aggregate
resource contains an Elements array that specifies the members of the aggregate. Actions that are supported on an
aggregate but not supported on all Elements , such as a Reset action that is not supported on an individual member
of the Elements array, are not silently skipped. If all members of the Elements array do not support the method, a
4xx status code shall be returned and the body shall contain an error response. If at least one member of the
Elements array successfully completed the action, but others did not, the status code should be 200 OK with
@Message.ExtendedInfo objects for the failed members.
16.2.4 Aggregation sources and connection methods
The aggregation service model also includes a definition for the information used to access the resources being
represented by the aggregator. Two collections of resources are used to represent this. These are the
AggregationSource and ConnectionMethod resources.
The AggregationSource resource represents the source of information for the resources being reflected by the
aggregator. It typically represents a lower layer service provided by another manager. It contains information needed
Redfish Specification DSP0266
204 Published Version 1.23.0
to access that source, such as the address and account information. It also has a reference to the ConnectionMethod
resource used to access it.
The ConnectionMethod resource represents the protocol and other semantics required to communicate with the
resources being aggregated. Examples of connection methods are Redfish, IPMI, and proprietary access methods.
For methods such as IPMI, it's also possible to specify the variations and nuances from multiple vendors.
