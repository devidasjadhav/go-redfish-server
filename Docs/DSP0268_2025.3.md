DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 7
1 Overview
The Redfish standard comprises a set of specifications maintained by the Redfish Forum, a working group within
DMTF. The standard defines a protocol that uses RESTful interfaces to provide access to data and operations
associated with the management of systems and networks. One of the strengths of the Redfish protocol is that it
works with a wide range of servers: from stand-alone servers to rack-mount and bladed environments to large-scale
data centers and cloud environments.
The Redfish standard addresses several key issues for infrastructures that require scalability. Large infrastructures
often consist of many simple servers of different makes and types. This hyper-scale usage model requires a new
approach to systems management. The Redfish protocol addresses these needs by providing a standard protocol
based on out-of-band systems management.
With these goals in mind, the Redfish protocol was designed as an open-industry standard to meet scalability
requirements in multi-vendor deployments. It easily integrates with commonly used tools, using RESTful interfaces to
perform operations and using JSON for data payloads.

2 Using this document
Every Redfish response consists of a JSON payload containing properties that are strictly defined by a schema for
that resource. The schema that defines a resource can be determined from the value of the @odata.type property
returned in every Redfish response. This document details the definitions for every Redfish standard schema.
Each schema section contains:
â¢ The name, current version, and description of the schema.
â¢ The release history of the schema. Lists each minor schema version and the DSP8010 release bundle that
included it.
â¢ List of the possible URIs where schema-defined resources can appear in a Redfish service following
specification version v1.6 or later. See URI listings.
â¢ Table that defines each property. Shows additional details for those properties when needed.
â¢ List of available actions defined for the schema.
â¢ Example JSON payload for a resource using the schema.
The property-level details include:
Column Purpose
Property
The case-sensitive name of the JSON property as it appears in the JSON payload.
Lists the schema version in parentheses when properties were added to or deprecated in the
schema after the initial v1.0.0 release.
Type
The JSON data types for the property, which can include boolean, number, string, or object.
```
â¢ The string (enum) tag identifies enumerated strings.
```
```
â¢ String types with a (URI) tag will contain a URI.
```
â¢ Number types may specify the units, which are usually included as part of the property name.
â¢ Number types specifying "%" units or including "Percent" in the property name will have values
typically in the range of 0 - 100
â¢ Boolean types will have a value of true or false .
DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 11
Column Purpose
Attributes
Designates whether:
â¢ The property is read-only or read-write, if supported by the implementation.
â¢ The property is required to be returned in the resource payload or is required when creating a
resource of that type.
â¢ The service might return a null value if the property value is temporarily unavailable.
Descriptions
The descriptions of the property, as copied directly from the schema's definition of the property.
The informational description of the property is listed first. The normative "long description" is
shown as a separate, bulleted list.
2.1 URI listings
The Redfish Specification v1.6.0 added mandatory support for the OpenAPI Specification v3.0. As part of this
support, the URIs for every Redfish resource are defined to appear at known, fixed locations. Resource collections
also appear at fixed locations, with the members of each collection appearing at URIs constructed by using a fixed
path structure, with appropriate path segments equal to the value of Id properties of members along the path.
Support for v1.6.0 and OpenAPI can be determined by comparing the value of the RedfishVersion property in the
```
service root ( /redfish/v1/ ). Services that report a 1.6.0 or higher value, such as 1.6.1 or 1.7.0 , adhere to the
```
URI definitions.
The URI listings do not apply to Redfish services that support specification versions earlier than v1.6.0. For those
services, clients must use the hypermedia features of the API to discover hyperlinks from the service root to each
resource. While services typically match the URIs listed in this document for many of their resources, this match is
not guaranteed and results in errors.

3 Common properties
3.1 Properties that all Redfish schemas define
The following properties are defined for inclusion in every Redfish schema and therefore may be encountered in any
response payload. They are documented here in this guide to avoid repetition in the Reference guide property tables.
```
Note: Several of these properties are payload annotations but appear here because they are required for all
```
Redfish resources.
3.1.1 Properties
Property Type Attributes Notes
```
@odata.context string(URI) read-only The value of this property shall be the context URL that describes the resource accordingto OData-Protocol and shall be of the form defined in the Redfish specification.
```
@odata.etag string read-only The value of this property shall be a string that is defined by the ETag HTTP headerdefinition in RFC7232.
```
@odata.id string(URI)read-onlyrequiredThe value of this property shall be the unique identifier for the resource and it shall be ofthe form defined in the Redfish specification.
```
@odata.type string read-onlyrequiredThe value of this property shall be a URI fragment that specifies the type of the resourceand it shall be of the form defined in the Redfish specification.
Description string read-only This property shall contain the description of this resource. The value shall conform withthe 'Description' clause of the Redfish Specification.
Id string read-onlyrequiredThis property shall contain the identifier for this resource. The value shall conform with the'Id' clause of the Redfish Specification.
Name string read-onlyrequiredThis property shall contain the name of this resource or array member. The value shallconform with the 'Name' clause of the Redfish Specification.
```
Oem {} object The manufacturer- or provider-specific extension moniker that divides the Oem object intosections.
```
3.2 Frequently used properties
In addition, the following properties are frequently defined in Redfish schemas. Their definition and usage is the
same throughout the Redfish data model.
DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 13
3.2.1 Properties
Property Type Attributes Notes
```
Actions {} object The Redfish actions available for this Resource.
```
```
Links {} object
```
The links associated with the Resource, as defined by that Resource's schema definition.
All associated reference properties defined for a Resource are nested under the Links
property. Find all directly referenced, or subordinate, Resource properties from the root of
the Resource.
RelatedItem [
```
{ array
```
An array of links. Each link points to a Resource or part of a Resource as defined by that
Resource's schema. This representation is not intended to be a strong linking methodology
like other references. Instead, it shows a relationship between elements or subelements in
disparate parts of the service. For example, fans might be in one area of the system and
processors in another. The relationship between the two might not be obvious. This
property can show that one is related to the other. In this example, it might indicate that a
specific fan cools a specific processor.
```
@odata.id string(URI) read-only The value of this property shall be the unique identifier for the resource and it shall be ofthe form defined in the Redfish specification.
```
```
} ]
```
3.3 Payload annotations
Payload annotations are a mechanism in which a service provides additional information about a given property or
object. Redfish limits usage of these annotations to OData core terms, Redfish extensions, or Redfish messages.
3.3.1 Property-level annotations
A payload annotation for a single property takes the form of an additional property named Property@Schema.Term ,
where Property is the JSON property being annotated, Schema is the schema file where the definition for the
annotation is found, and Term is the name of the annotation.
3.3.2 Properties
Property Type Attributes Notes
```
@Message.ExtendedInfo {} object
```
The additional information for a set of message structures for a property.
These messages can be useful when a property is null due to an error
condition and the service wants to convey why the property is null .
Redfish Data Model Specification DSP0268
14 Published Version 2025.3
Property Type Attributes Notes
@odata.count integer read-only The value of this property shall be an integer representing the number of itemsin a collection.
@Redfish.AllowableNumbers
[ ]
array
```
(string) read-only
```
The numeric values or duration values, inclusive ranges of values, and
```
(optional) incremental step values for a read-write property or action
```
parameter, in a <min>:<max>:<step> format.
@Redfish.AllowablePattern string read-only A regular expression that describes the allowable values for a read-writeproperty or action parameter as supported by the service.
@Redfish.AllowableValues [
]
array
```
(string) read-only The string values that a service accepts for a property or action parameter.
```
@Redfish.Deprecated string read-only Specifies that the property or value is deprecated. The string value explainsthe deprecation, including new property or properties or value to use.
In the following example, the property ResetType is annotated with the Redfish schema-defined AllowableValues
term. Redfish is an alias for RedfishExtensions . This term indicates to the client that the service supports the
values On and ForceOff for ResetType .
```
{
```
"ResetType@Redfish.AllowableValues": [
"On",
"ForceOff"
]
```
}
```
3.3.3 Resource-level or object-level annotations
A payload annotation for an entire Resource or a JSON object takes the @Schema.Term form, where Schema is the
schema file where the definition is found and Term is the name of the annotation. These payload annotations are
used to provide further information about the object itself.
3.3.4 Properties
Property Type Attributes Notes

```
@Redfish.WriteableProperties [ ] array(string) read-only
```
Specifies the properties supported as read-write. The values contained
are the names of the writable properties as defined in the Redfish
schema that are available as read-write given the implementation,
current configuration, and state of the resource.

Methods used to determine the value of this property can vary between different architectures and requirements of
the underlying product. This property does not necessarily surface the most degraded health from all subordinate
resources. For example, if a PowerSupply resource contains Critical for its Health property, but belongs to a
redundancy group that is still able to power the parent Chassis resource, the Chassis resource could report
Warning for the HealthRollup property, depending on the redundancy policy for the Chassis resource. Using the
same PowerSupply example, the ComputerSystem resource associated with this Chassis resource could degrade its

5 Resource collections
A resource collection is a core concept in Redfish. A resource collection is a group of like resources where the
number of instances in the group can shrink or grow depending on the scope of the Redfish service or the
configuration of the devices being managed. Every resource collection contains the same set of supported
properties, and all contain Collection in the name of their schema. Every resource linked in the Members array
within a resource collection will have the same resource type with the same major version but can vary in minor or
errata schema versions.
The properties of a resource collection are:

AccountLockoutCounterResetAfter integer(seconds) read-write
```
The period of time, in seconds, between the last failed login attempt
and the reset of the lockout threshold counter. This value must be
less than or equal to the AccountLockoutDuration value. A reset sets
the counter to 0 .
â¢ This property shall contain the period of time, in seconds, from
the last failed login attempt when the AccountLockoutThreshold
counter, which counts the number of failed login attempts, is
reset to 0 . Then, AccountLockoutThreshold failures are

are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .

string Description
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

string Description
ForceOff
```
Turn off the unit immediately (non-graceful shutdown).
```
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the
value Off .
ForceOn
Turn on the unit immediately.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property shall contain the value On .
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .

complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

6.19.5 Property details
6.19.5.1 CertificateString
The string for the certificate.
â¢ This property shall contain the certificate, and the format shall follow the requirements specified by the
CertificateType property value. If the certificate contains any private keys, they shall be removed from the
string in responses. If the service does not know the private key for the certificate and is needed to use the
certificate, the client shall provide the private key as part of the string in the POST request. For additional
property requirements, see the corresponding definition in the Redfish Data Model Specification.
When a certificate of type PEMchain or PKCS7 is installed, the service may create multiple resources to represent
each of the certificates found in the string. If the service divides the request into multiple resources, the service:
â¢ Shall provide the response with the resource that represents the first certificate in the string.
Redfish Data Model Specification DSP0268
294 Published Version 2025.3
â¢ Shall apply the appropriate value for CertificateType for each of the new resources.
â¢ Should populate the Issuer property within the Links property.
â¢ May populate the Subjects property within the Links property.
To satisfy JSON encoding requirements, newlines in the string shall be replaced with \n . Standard JSON libraries
typically manage this conversion automatically.
6.19.5.2 CertificateType
The format of the certificate.
â¢ This property shall contain the format type for the certificate. For additional property requirements, see the
corresponding definition in the Redfish Data Model Specification.
6.19.5.2.1 PEMchain
When the value of CertificateType is PEMchain , the format represents a series of certificates. The format shall be a
concatenation, in order, of the following:
â¢ The private key of the leaf certificate.
â¦ The private key may be omitted.
â¢ The leaf certificate for the end entity.
â¦ The leaf certificate may be omitted.
â¦ If the leaf certificate is omitted, the private key shall be omitted.
```
â¢ A set of certificate authority (CA) certificates in order of issuance.
```
The private key shall be encoded as described in section 10 of RFC7468.
The leaf certificate and CA certificates shall be certificates as defined by RFC5280 and shall be encoded as
described in section 5 of RFC7468.
Each certificate in the set of CA certificates shall be the issuer of the preceding certificate. For example, the first CA
certificate is the issuer of the leaf certificate, the second CA certificate is the issuer of the first CA certificate, and so
on. The last CA certificate typically represents the root CA and is self-signed. The set of certificates should contain all
certificates leading to the root CA.
The following example for a PEMchain certificate contains three certificates: the leaf certificate for "*.dmtf.org", the
CA certificate "Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority - G2", and the root CA certificate "Go Daddy Root Certificate
Authority - G2".

6.28.5.30 UUID
The UUID for this system.
â¢ This property shall contain the universally unique identifier number for this system. RFC4122 describes methods
to create this value. The value should be considered to be opaque. Client software should only treat the overall
value as a UUID and should not interpret any subfields within the UUID. If the system supports SMBIOS, the
property value should follow the SMBIOS 2.6 and later recommendation for converting the SMBIOS 16-byte
UUID structure into the Redfish canonical xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx string format, so that the
property value matches the byte order presented by current OS APIs, such as WMI and dmidecode. For
additional property requirements, see the corresponding definition in the Redfish Data Model Specification.
```
Pattern: ^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$
```
```
The UUID property contains the value of the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) of a system, also known in some
```
```
systems as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128 bits long (16 bytes).
```
DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 469
Redfish clients should consider the value of the property to be opaque and should not interpret any sub-fields within
the UUID.
The UUID property is a string data type. The RFC4122-specified 36-character string format is xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-
xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx , where each x represents a hexadecimal value from 0 to f .
If the computer system supports SMBIOS, the UUID string should be formed from the raw binary 16-byte SMBIOS
UUID structure. This allows out-of-band clients to correlate the UUID that in-band agents are reading from SMBIOS.
The UUID is represented out-of-band through the Redfish API.
6.28.5.30.1 Case sensitivity
Regarding the case of the hex values, RFC4122 specifies that the hex values should be lowercase characters. Most
modern scripting languages typically also represent hex values in lowercase characters following the RFC. However,
dmidecode, WMI and some Redfish implementations currently use uppercase characters for UUID on output.
Comparisons between UUID values should always be case-insensitive.
For new Redfish implementations, the recommendation is to follow RFC4122 guidelines: output using lower-case hex
values when converting from the SMBIOS raw binary data.
Redfish implementations and operating system APIs are permitted to output in uppercase. For that reason, Redfish
```
clients MUST compare UUIDs using a case-insensitive comparison (as recommended by RFC4122).
```
6.28.5.30.2 Conversion of UUID format
The SMBIOS 2.6 and later specification specifies the proper algorithm for converting the raw binary SMBIOS 16-byte
structure into the canonical string format of xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx . Redfish services should follow the
SMBIOS 2.6 and later specification for implementing this conversion.
WMI and Linux dmidecode also follow the SMBIOS guidelines.
Specifically, RFC4122 defines that the canonical string value should follow network byte ordering. The SMBIOS
represents the UUID as these fields:
```
{
```
DWORD time_low,
WORD time_mid,
WORD time_hi_and_version,
BYTE clock_seq_hi_and_reserved,
BYTE clock_seq_low,
BYTE[6] node
```
}
```
Redfish Data Model Specification DSP0268
470 Published Version 2025.3
```
Little-endian systems (including x86 systems) require a little-endian to network-byte-order conversion for the first
```
three fields in order to convert the SMBIOS binary UUID to network byte order.
As specified in the SMBIOS 2.6 and later specifications, if the canonical UUID string is:
00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff
The corresponding raw representation in the SMBIOS UUID structure is:
```
raw_smbios_uuid = {
```
0x33,
0x22,
0x11,
0x00,
0x55,
0x44,
0x77,
0x66,
0x88,
0x99,
0xAA,
0xBB,
0xCC,
0xDD,
0xEE,
0xFF
```
}
```
Notice in the above SMBIOS representation that each of the first three words boundaries are in little-endian order.
For example, the hex digits 00112233 are represented by the first raw SMBIOS 4-byte DWORD 0x33 0x22 0x11
0x00 .
```
The following sample code (written in C) could be used to convert the raw SMBIOS UUID struct in a little-endian
```
system to the 35-character canonical string:
/* routine to convert raw little-endian smbios structure to canonical string */
```
sprintf(
```
redfishUUID,
"%02x%02x%02x%02x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x",
raw_smbios_uuid[3], raw_smbios_uuid[2],
raw_smbios_uuid[1], raw_smbios_uuid[0],
raw_smbios_uuid[5], raw_smbios_uuid[4],
raw_smbios_uuid[7], raw_smbios_uuid[6],
raw_smbios_uuid[8], raw_smbios_uuid[9],
DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 471
raw_smbios_uuid[10], raw_smbios_uuid[11],
raw_smbios_uuid[12], raw_smbios_uuid[13],
raw_smbios_uuid[14], raw_smbios_uuid[15]
```
);
```
The previous sample code creates the same canonically formatted string as WMI and dmidecode for little-endian x86
systems.
If the computer architecture is not little-endian, then the conversion and canonical representation should be the same
as the operating system's APIs, such as WMI and dmidecode.
```
Note: As specified in RFC4122, the fields in the string should be zero-filled hexadecimal values, as shown in
```
the previous conversion code, so that the overall string length and format is xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-
xxxxxxxxxx .

without the parameter and shall perform a GracefulRestart .
string Description
ForceOff
```
Turn off the unit immediately (non-graceful shutdown).
```
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the
value Off .
ForceOn
Turn on the unit immediately.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property shall contain the value On .
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .

Version 2025.3 Published 493
string Description
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
Redfish Data Model Specification DSP0268
494 Published Version 2025.3
string Description
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .

PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .
6.38.5.15 SanitizationType
The type of data sanitization to perform.
â¢ This parameter shall contain the type of data sanitization to perform for the secure erase request. The service
can accept a request without the parameter and perform an implementation-specific default secure erase.
string Description

string Description
ForceOff
```
Turn off the unit immediately (non-graceful shutdown).
```
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the
value Off .
ForceOn
Turn on the unit immediately.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property shall contain the value On .
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .

complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

string Description
ForceOff
```
Turn off the unit immediately (non-graceful shutdown).
```
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the
value Off .
ForceOn
Turn on the unit immediately.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property shall contain the value On .
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
Redfish Data Model Specification DSP0268
940 Published Version 2025.3
string Description
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 941
string Description
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.

string Description
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

ForceOff
```
Turn off the unit immediately (non-graceful shutdown).
```
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the
value Off .
ForceOn
Turn on the unit immediately.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property shall contain the value On .
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .

string Description
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .

Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

string Description
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 1307
string Description
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .

DSP0268 Redfish Data Model Specification
Version 2025.3 Published 1605
string Description
ForceOn
Turn on the unit immediately.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. The transition will start
immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property shall contain the value On .
ForceRestart
Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start immediately. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
FullPowerCycle
```
Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like removing utility lines, followed by
```
restoring utility lines to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full power cycle as if utility lines to the resource
are removed and restored. The transition will start immediately. This is different from PowerCycle in
that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible. For example, removing AC power cables from an
enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables. If currently in the power on state, the resource will
transition to a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state,
the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
if supported, shall contain the value On . If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
power cycle flows, the service shall support PowerCycle as an alias to FullPowerCycle . This type of
reset may cause the manager providing the Redfish service to power cycle. If the manager providing
the Redfish service is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response before
resetting to prevent client timeouts.
GracefulRestart
Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state, after transiting through a
restart. The transition will start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For
example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut
down processes and close connections. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value On .
GracefulShutdown
Shut down gracefully and power off.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power off state. The transition will start after
first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource. For example, when shutting down a computer
system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.
Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Off .
Nmi
Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems, to stop normal operations,
complete diagnostic actions, and, typically, halt the system.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
Redfish Data Model Specification DSP0268

string Description
On
Turn on the unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Pause
Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power. This is typically a feature of virtual machine
hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value Paused .
PowerCycle
```
Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful). Behaves like a power removal, followed by a power
```
restore to the resource.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle. The transition will start immediately.
This is different from FullPowerCycle in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the
resource while external power is still present. For example, turning DC voltage regulators off and then
turning DC voltage regulators back on. If currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to
a power off state, then transition to a power on state. If currently in the power off state, the resource
will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
shall contain the value On .
PushPowerButton
Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this unit.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if the physical power button is pressed. The
behavior of pressing the physical power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the
behavior may be configurable.
Resume
Resume execution on the paused unit. This is typically a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on state. Upon successful completion,
the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value On .
Suspend
Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off. This allows for the state to be restored when
powered back on.
â¢ This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information written to persistent memory and
then transition to a power off state. Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if
supported, shall contain the value Off .
